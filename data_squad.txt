Chris Acker: You set your nickname to Toum.
Chris Acker: You set the nickname for a participant to Groke.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Uhhh sword
Daniel Strizhevsky: Boring
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Zeush aren't you supposedly in a meeting right now
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Then you shouldn't have time to bully me based on my weapon of choice
Daniel Strizhevsky: No I have time
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Fine I will use the sitton
Zach Gospe: Huzzah! 

I think I'll be using either the life staff or the fire staff / ice gauntlet if you want to take life, Dan. Magic is cool üòé üî•üå≤‚ùÑÔ∏è
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker: Actually @Zeush has been playing a lot with the warhammer
Chris Acker: Maybe Dan can be our heavy weight boy
Chris Acker: And Zach can be our magic healer
Chris Acker: And I'll be our spearman
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What about me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You didn't say what I am
Zach Gospe: If chris and Dan are two-handed melee boys, we could probably use another ranged weapon in the party, or maybe a sword and shield.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm undecided still
Daniel Strizhevsky: I wanna try a musket or bow or magic once I get my gaming computer and can aim
Daniel Strizhevsky: Remember everyone gets 2 weapons :)
Daniel Strizhevsky: I might also switch to a rapier
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will do sword and shield
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And then I will try some kind of range weapon
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Maybe a bow and arrow
Zach Gospe: Sheeesh that sounds bussin
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm thinking maybe bow with my war hammer to get that +10% move speed ability
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm gaming if anyone wants to join

Zach Gospe: Looks like I need to acquire a registration code from Moises to create an account
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I asked him if you needed anything and he said you should have something in your email
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If not hit him up and I'll PERSONALLY go down there to ensure a speedy reply lol
Zach Gospe: Lol okay I am not seeing it in my email. I'll follow up with him very nicely, and you can play the bad cop :D
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Groke did he respond or should I bus down there
Zach Gospe: No response yet but let's give him another hour or so in case he was just out to lunch or something
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: Moises responded at 2 that I should be receiving an email about it, but it has not arrived yet. 

I do have a different email from Encore about maintenance requests, so clearly I'm on some list, it's just document signing piece hasn't come through yet.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Alright if it doesn't come in by tomorrow morning I can go down there and inquire
Zach Gospe: Classic Pentagon P rolling in to scout out B site
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Zach Gospe: Moises had to redo the lease, but I was able to sign it now. I believe you all will need to re-sign it though, unfortunately.

Daniel Strizhevsky: as the lease has been signed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Please look at the competitors listing and tell me what your thoughts are about the offer. Our team will be very pleased with renewing your lease for another term!
Daniel Strizhevsky: Does this mean they're open to negotiation?
Chris Acker: Yes it seems like it
Daniel Strizhevsky: We should ask about shorter leases as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: But
Daniel Strizhevsky: These prices are better than I was expecting
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah let's email about shorter leases
Chris Acker: Okay but I don't want to go too short
Chris Acker: Unless we don't like the price and want to move somewhere else
Chris Acker: If we like the price we shouldn't risk having to renegotiate
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah Moises only told us 12 months or month to month lease
Chris Acker: As they might just increase it again
Zach Gospe: Reacted üëç to your message 
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I would like to find out what the prices for 6 month or 8 month lease are
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'll send an email to ask that one

Zach Gospe: I only did 3 for 5/9, but did all four for 5/16. Not sure how to represent that in the Splitwise
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So you would do title 5/9 and then pay each of us a dollar. You don't have to do anything for 5/16
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Splitwise is kinda weird so you will have to make 3 5/9 payments
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So like you will say Chris paid and you owe him a dollar

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello sirs @Toum @Groke
Daniel Strizhevsky: Although samvrutha has tested negative for COVID her sore throat /cough is worsening
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should we get a hotel/airbnb? Or just lock ourselves in our room or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or test again tomorrow morning and see what happens
Chris Acker: Lol Zach is surrounded by covid
Chris Acker: From all angles
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poor snackary
Daniel Strizhevsky: No escape for him
Chris Acker: Zach has a bachelor party to attend this weekend which he's been organizing so I'd say his opinion on the matter comes first
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky: Holy cow the famous party is this weekend!?!
Chris Acker: In my case, the less important case, I'm okay if you guys just quarantine in your room and wear masks when exiting/entering
Chris Acker: Maybe get doordash and such instead of spending time cooking in the kitchen and touching things?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah that sounds reasonable, let's wait and see what @Groke thinks. We can also get a hotel until Zach's event
Zach Gospe: My bachelor party unfortunately just got canceled due to Covid unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ü•∫
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Can Dan spread it if he's immune after having it?
Chris Acker: Wouldn't his super-immune white blood cells just destroy that business?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: I recommend giving the kitchen a quick scrub down cause I was in there earlier today
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And maybe opening up the windows in the living room to air it out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Sounds good to me
Daniel Strizhevsky: And we'll test samvrutha again tomorrow
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should I buy some paper plates for me and samvrutha to use?
Daniel Strizhevsky: So that we can just throw it out directly

Daniel Strizhevsky: But tbh I think it's fine to do tomorrow morning
Zach Gospe: Okay sounds good. I am in the middle of verifying my bank account with them so I can't pay directly without a fee anyway at the moment.

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Daniel Strizhevsky: Does Dhruv know sarin doesn't like him
Chris Acker: Yeah but he probably thinks if he can get over it than Sarin can
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: Hmmm I might offer to do half the trip with dhruv and then join you guys later or something

Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is a big predicament indeed!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Are you still going to buy flights with us

Chris Acker: It would just change possibly accommodations and destinations along the way
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ah ok ok so maybe you start with us split off for a bit and then rejoin?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol are you guys gonna go to literally the same countries and cities üòÇ
Chris Acker: I imagine I'd meet Dhruv at Heathrow and we'd go our separate ways lol

Daniel Strizhevsky: Agree with this question
Zach Gospe: My throat is in lots of pain, but the fever is much lower now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: That's good! Do you feel you are on the up and up now

Daniel Strizhevsky: You are welcome
Zach Gospe: Hello and welcome to today's episode of Zach Addresses Current Health, or Z.A.C.H. for short. 

Day 10 after symptoms. Though my symptoms have greatly improved and the fever has been gone for 4 days, I retain slight congestion and a very mild cough. I am testing positive on the at-home antigen tests still. 

While the CDC doubts I am very contagious given these circumstances, I will continue to wear my mask and mostly isolate in my room for this evening and likely tomorrow as well.

Thank you for listening. Please address any questions about Z.A.C.H. to your local congressperson.
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: Thank you Zach for today's Z.A.C.H.
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: I hope your mild congestion and cough subside soon so you may return to being a Happy Zachary once more
Zach Gospe: Thank you for the kind words. I hope so as well. Being a Congested Zachary makes it impossible to be a Happy Zachary, as I can only have one adjective active at a time.

Zach Gospe: Hello and welcome to today's Zach Addresses Current Health and Recalls Yesterday, otherwise known as Z.A.C.H.A.R.Y. 

I am continuing to experience a very mild cough and have tested positive for again on the antigen test. As it is day 11, it is very unlikely that I am contagious. Yet, I will continue to mask and remain mostly isolated today. 

I will plan to isolate again tomorrow, but will likely leave my bubble on Friday unless anyone feels uncomfortable with that.

I have developed a mild fever today but it might be getting worse ü•∫.  I'll take quarantining precautions, and I advise you to wear masks
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Uh oh
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Do you need a covid test?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also let us know if you need us to pick up food or medicine for you from the store!
Chris Acker: I have two with me
Daniel Strizhevsky: Holy cow
Chris Acker: Should I take one now or wait a bit
Daniel Strizhevsky: Had the Zacharias spread
Zach Gospe: Oh no sir please let us know the result of your Covid test. I am very sorry to hear of this development
Chris Acker: Not sure if it's Zach's or not
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Could also be from the flight
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Considering we were around a lot of people
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And Zach has been hardly seen for the past few days
Chris Acker: Yeah we had two long flights back, and navigated 3 airports
Chris Acker: So could be either I guess
Zach Gospe: It has only been two days since you got back so it seems pretty quick for it to be from me. But certainly possible since we share that bathroom
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Yeah it would be a bit quick
Daniel Strizhevsky: Were you near any Sketchy People last flight?
Chris Acker: Lol I don't think so
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I thought I heard a child or two cough on our flight
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Children are vectors of disease
Zach Gospe reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: Yeah I heard that as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: -samvrutha 2022
Chris Acker: We did wear masks on that flight but
Chris Acker: Maybe wasn't enough
Chris Acker: If no one minds I might turn the thermostat down a bit to help with fever
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes do what you need to get better

Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Though I guess technically Zach is safe?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Door to the outside*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Unless Chris has a European strain or pulls a samvrutha and has the flu instead
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes outside door or window lol
Zach Gospe: I am not going to assume I'm safe
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: I may go to my parents actually so Chris you can have your own bathroom
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: That might be a good idea
Chris Acker: Thanks buh
Daniel Strizhevsky: I've learned my lesson from assuming I'm safe last time
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Christopher do you have any high quality n95/kn95 masks
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can get some to you if not
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do we still have Wipey Boys?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can get some of those as well if not
Daniel Strizhevsky: Samvrutha and I can go on an after-work cvs run for any Needs
Zach Gospe: Also I highly recommend NyQuil at night and ibuprofen or Tylenol every six hours (except when taking NyQuil)
Zach Gospe: Do not be fooled by the fever being mild at first if this is Covid. Medicate early and don't fall into my mistakes lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: We have a bottle of Mucinex and half a bottle of butter
Daniel Strizhevsky: NyQuil
Daniel Strizhevsky: And some Emergen-C packets
Chris Acker: I have kn95s
Chris Acker: Zach has put wipeys in our bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: I will bring these medications to your door

Daniel Strizhevsky: Items will be on your right upon exiting the door
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah
Chris Acker: Ty ty
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My doctor said you can also alternate between Tylenol and Advil because one is processed by kidney and one by your liver
Samvrutha Tumuluru: When I had a fever I was close to the Tylenol daily limit so knowing that would have helped greatly
Zach Gospe: Drink many liquids as well @Chris Acker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How are you feeling @Christopher
Chris Acker: Much better now.  But that might just be the ibuprofen I took 3 hrs ago
Chris Acker: Currently I am at 98.6 degrees F
Daniel Strizhevsky: Very good, a respectful temperature
Chris Acker: I have tested positive with the covid
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Daniel Strizhevsky: Very good
Chris Acker: I assume you guys are still feeling good?
Daniel Strizhevsky: So far yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yup!
Zach Gospe: Toum any other symptoms going on beyond that fever?
Chris Acker: My throat is a bit scratchy now but otherwise it's just the fever.
Chris Acker: Although the ibuprofen seems to be taking care of the fever as I'm currently at 98.4
Chris Acker: How is your cough grokey
Zach Gospe: Okay sounds really similar to my experience so far.

Chris Acker: Did he look displeased about the fan
Chris Acker: Did he give it a look that said ‚Äúwait haven't I seen this on Amazon for $17 dollars‚Äù
Daniel Strizhevsky: Unfortunately he did not say that
Daniel Strizhevsky: To be fair I think the Amazon one is +$5 shipping
Chris Acker: To be fair it's usually 19.99
Daniel Strizhevsky: But on target it is 17 with no shipping
Daniel Strizhevsky: Cost

Chris Acker: So I wasn't testing
Chris Acker: Are you testing negative now?
Zach Gospe: Yeah a positive test doesn't necessarily mean you're contagious, but a negative test means you definitely aren't.
Zach Gospe: I am testing negative now
Zach Gospe: From what I read, there is a chance you're still contagious from day 10-14 if you are testing positive still. After day 14 if you test positive it's like a fraction of a percent chance you can spread it still

Zach Gospe: The One Party to Rule Them All
(Keep it secret, keep it safe)

Dearest friend,

You are cordially invited to a long-awaited party: a Lord of the Rings extended edition marathon from noon to midnight on Saturday, October 8th. Themed cocktails will be provided at key moments and all other moments as well. Feel free to arrive with a fellowship of your choosing (invite whoever you want).

Like a wizard, please arrive precisely when you mean to (read: feel free to pop in whenever!). Actually watching the movies is not required, there will be plenty else to do, including mingling, drinking, games, and general party shenanigans.

Location: 855 Veterans Blvd, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA. Apartment 502 (and the roof). Step inside and be the farthest from the shire you've ever been, Mr. Frodo. 

What to expect:
* The Lord of the Rings extended edition for extended fun
* 12 hours of Orc ASMR
* (Lord of the) Ring pops
* Magnificent views of the beautiful Redwood City skyline to rival Rivendell
* Chris and Zach drinking every time Frodo looks like he's about to cry

What not to expect:
* Campfire songs with Ed Sheeran
* Dumbledore (that'll be the next party)
* Samvrutha and Dan actually watching Lord of the Rings
* Zach and Chris actually not watching Lord or the Rings
* Cats (no one is bringing a cat)
* Loans
* Someone stealing your sweet roll

Chris Acker: Ok
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 3 people in that wine group have seen the message 0 have responded at all
Zach Gospe: I bet they are checking their calendar still
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is bad
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is really bad
Chris Acker: lol lol lol
Zach Gospe: Or maybe they are setting up a separate group chat with all of them to check if anyone else is going. And then they'll agree it's all worth it and decide to sign up all at once in like 2 days
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ

Chris Acker: Does he work for capital one or something
Chris Acker: I have three mutual friends with him
Chris Acker: One from Vanderbilt and two from capital one
Zach Gospe: Maybe? I know he doesn't work there now though. I think he used to live in Virginia roughly where you used to live so maybe that's why.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Another slightly less gimmicky idea

Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be respectfully declining to dress up but will support others fully in the dressing
Zach Gospe: What if we get you a very smol thing to wear?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'd consider it under these conditions:
1) It's small enough I wouldn't feel bad about throwing it out
2) it's not made of plastic so I don't feel bad about throwing it out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: For example I would be ok with a paper hat
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or paper wand
Zach Gospe: Deal. What if it's something that you don't throw out because I could keep it after
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah if it is something you would be interested in keeping and thus it doesn't get thrown out at all then I would also be ok with that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Anyone else having internet troubles?

Daniel Strizhevsky: Wah wah wah
Daniel Strizhevsky: @everyone any rice today?

Daniel Strizhevsky: And @Christopher?
Zach Gospe: Chris what was your time on track 1
Chris Acker: 18.185
Zach Gospe: Frick that's good
Zach Gospe: Did you save the replay?
Zach Gospe: I am at 18.4
Zach Gospe: Hello folks quick health checkin. 

I still have a bit of a sore throat and a cough, but in terms of energy levels and such I feel basically normal. My plan for today is to finish up work and then sleep as much as possible to make sure I'm okay for the party tomorrow.
Zach Gospe: Are you all okay to pitch in for some of the remaining party prep? Such as cleaning the apartment, acquiring snacks and remaining ingredients for drinks, and double checking we can play the extended edition movies?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Samvrutha and I have acquired some Snacks. I'm assuming we'll order pizza or something of the Ilk during the party as well?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes the snacks are covered we bought sweet and salty snacks at Joes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Are you sure you'll be recovered in time for this party?

Chris Acker: Thx tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: Freezer boy
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ùì
Chris Acker: But naaaa
Zach Gospe: Hello lady and gents we have good movement in symptoms but still much work to do. 

Sore throat is easing up and the dry, unproductive cough is setting in. This is a good step and means I am in the last stage of contagion.

My nose is becoming runny instead of congested as well which also means that things are easing up. 

I shall continue to rotate between eating, drinking, and sleeping and keep you updated.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should we consider cancelling??
Chris Acker: ^^ good question
Chris Acker: If yur not there I think we should cancel, so it's a question of how last minute it is
Zach Gospe: This is the only weekend we can have this party right?
Daniel Strizhevsky: In theory we could have it next weekend when yuta is here? Idk
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true though if people would still be available is the question
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also would we want to do a 12 hour thing with one of babas 2 days here is also an open question
Chris Acker: Yah in the worse case we could do it when yuta is here
Zach Gospe: I think a good portion of my friends who could make it tomorrow and are bringing other people will be in Tahoe next weekend
Zach Gospe: So the yuta weekend is a no go in terms of turnout I would guess
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm gonna order toilet paper on Doordash
Zach Gospe: So close but yet so far. After 12 hours of sleeping I still have the last little bit of a sore throat. I'm going to begin the cancellation process of the party
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Zach Gospe: Rip
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Rip
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok I will message people
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Zach Gospe will you post on the FB?
Zach Gospe: I have cancelled the fb event with a little note
Zach Gospe: I have then proceeded to text a bunch of folks
Zach Gospe: Any contribution to the communication situation would be lovely
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Wait what is the message
Chris Acker: Are we trying to do this next week or cancelled indefinitely?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just said cancelled cause roommate is sick
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Did not mention any future plans
Zach Gospe: I said we were hoping to reschedule at some point and I'd let people know if/when that happens
Zach Gospe: The message is roommate is sick
Zach Gospe: For people who knew I was already sick early this week I said I'm still sick, and I also added that one of you was also feeling sick so back me up on that white lie if anyone mentions it :)
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Zach Gospe: Gotta protect the reputation ya feel?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: lol you still feeling sick wasn't enough?
Chris Acker: I'll back you up buh
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: I basically didn't want to tell certain people that my roommates didn't feel comfy hosting the party without me
Chris Acker: oh ok
Chris Acker: OK so heres an idea: What if we just host a normal party when yuta is here this coming weekend (as I assume Yuta, Daniel, and Samvrutha don't really care about the LOTR theme), which can be smaller scale, and then you and I can do the LOTR party later without the afformentioned.  Then Yuta could also invite the friends he wants to see
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Should we ask him first if he is interested
Zach Gospe: There's still a bunch of people who wouldn't be able to make next weekend on my end but that's probably okay if we're doing a smaller party
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: Let's ask yuta and see what he says
Chris Acker: Yeah no problem
Chris Acker: @Zach Gospe yuta has given us the GO AHEAD on the party
Zach Gospe: Okay that bustling
Zach Gospe: I‚Äòll send out invites once I am no longer sick

Zach Gospe: Lovely Ty
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello sirs! My friend Jerry Li in the apartment very close by to us is hosting a poker night this Friday
Daniel Strizhevsky: Anyone want to join me in joining the poker night? $50 buy in I think
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: I'm scared
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Me too
Chris Acker: It is my right as an American to be so üá∫üá∏
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: No
Daniel Strizhevsky: Think of it as a $50 fee to play a fun game for a few hours, with a chance of magically receiving some money
Daniel Strizhevsky: Then there is no fear
Chris Acker: But as I know nothing about poker I have little chance of receiving it
Chris Acker: And I know really know any of the attendees
Daniel Strizhevsky: Me neither
Daniel Strizhevsky: To both of those
Chris Acker: So it's like paging 50 to sit at a table with strangers
Daniel Strizhevsky: Frick yeah
Chris Acker: Then what is your reason for attending lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Cause poker is fun
Chris Acker: Really??????
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Zach Gospe: Do we have a guest list and are they cool people / are they really good at poker?
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's Jerry who I know from Robinhood, and possibly Minh who you all met at the party
Daniel Strizhevsky: Others I don't know
Daniel Strizhevsky: No idea how good they are at poker either
Daniel Strizhevsky: Minh will be there confirmed
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just remembered I have an offsite on Friday
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I will be doing stuff
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Offsite onsite
Daniel Strizhevsky: You can come after
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just remembered after the offsite is dinner
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok mainly it's like $50 must mean these people are really good at poker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like $20 that's a regular joe shmow
Samvrutha Tumuluru: $50 is like yeah I play often and seriously
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Can I cash out at anytime?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: For example $50 buy in but then when I lose $20 I quit and just hang out instead?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think as long as you don't do that in like the first 10 mins it's fine
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How much is big blind
Daniel Strizhevsky: Blinds are $0.25/$0.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think as people get older and richer the $10 games of yesteryear are gone
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jerry said yeah it's buy-in whatever buy-out whatever anytime you want
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I can buy in with only $15 if I want
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or perhaps even $10
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe but you'd be at a huge disadvantage
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Cause people could crush me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also I have another question
Daniel Strizhevsky: Just buy in 50 and cash out when you hit 35 or something
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Could I come and just hang out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And like be a silent observer on your team
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or is that not allowed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee
Daniel Strizhevsky: But
Daniel Strizhevsky: I don't trust your poker face
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jerry will also be providing board games
Daniel Strizhevsky: In case you guys decide not to play
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok I am more interested now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will still play it by ear based on how tired I am
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But this is more enticing
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'm so sleepy
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Wrong chat

Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevsky lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol what are the financial experts arguments
Chris Acker: I think it's because if you take it in cash, you only get $597 million
Chris Acker: That's before taxes
Chris Acker: You only get the full 1.2 billion if you take it over time
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: It would be the same as taking the cash and then making an average of 4.3% in the markets every year for 30 years
Chris Acker: So if you think you can do better than that, you should take the cash, otherwise, take the annuity
Chris Acker: Basically, I think powerball itself wants to invest the cash, and they would take a cut of the investment return, but guarantee you the 1.6 billion, using their earnings from ticket sales as collateral
Chris Acker: If you took the cash now, you could possibly do better in the markets overtime, but you have no guarantee
Daniel Strizhevsky: Interesting I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: If any Ricetophers are making rice, I'd like one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Zach Gospe are you ok!

I did just have Covid two months ago so I'm hoping I'm safe, though with my other health issues lingering I wouldn't be surprised if my immune system isn't great at the moment. Will keep you updated. 

Would you all like me to quarantine for now?
Chris Acker: While you are probably safe I'll be seeing my fam in a few days so quarantining until I am gone would be appreciated

Zach Gospe: Can do, good sir
Zach Gospe: I'll make sure to wipe down the bathroom throughly with each use
Chris Acker: I hope your mom is okay though

Zach Gospe: I will be masked in the kitchen making some food in a moment please be advised
Zach Gospe: Still testing negative for the Rona. I also have a doctor appt tomorrow so will keep you updated then.

Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris, I'm impressed that you've reached 7000 campaign points in Trackmania, but I think you have the potential to do even better. Why don't you try to increase your score and see how high you can go?" This approach encourages Chris to continue playing and improving his skills in order to reach a higher level of success in the game.

Daniel Strizhevsky: "Hey Chris, I noticed that you only have 7000 campaign points in Trackmania. Don't you think it's time to step up your game and join the ranks of the over 9000 campaign point club like the rest of us?"
Daniel Strizhevsky: Would you say this statement conveys my frustration your lack of progress in the game, while also providing a gentle nudge for you to improve your skills and progress further in the game?
Chris Acker: I know that you're really proud of your campaign points in Trackmania, but I wanted to let you know that they don't necessarily reflect your skill as a player. Campaign points are just a way to measure progress through the game's single-player content, and they don't take into account factors like your speed, precision, and overall racing ability. So don't get too caught up in your campaign points
Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris, I know that you're a great player in Trackmania, but campaign points are the most important metric of success in the game. They take into account your speed, precision, and overall skill level, and they're the best way to compare your performance to other players. So, if you want to be considered one of the best players in the game, you need to focus on earning as many campaign points as possible.
Chris Acker: Dear fans and followers,

I am excited to announce that I will be starting a new series on my YouTube channel, GeoWizard Plays Trackmania! As many of you know, I am a geography enthusiast and I love sharing my knowledge and passion for the world around us with all of you.

Recently, I have developed a love for the game Trackmania, and I am excited to share my experiences with you. Trackmania is a fast-paced and challenging racing game that offers a unique and exciting gameplay experience. I can't wait to dive in and start playing, and I hope you will join me on this new adventure.

Stay tuned for more updates and information about my new series, and I hope you will join me on my channel as I explore the world of Trackmania.

Sincerely,
GeoWizard

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hi everyone,

I'm excited to announce that I will be starting to play Geoguessr and creating lots of related content on my channel. I've been a huge fan of this game for a while now, and I can't wait to share my adventures and challenges with you all.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Geoguessr, it's a fun and exciting game that challenges players to guess the location of a randomly generated street view from around the world. It's a great way to test your geography skills and learn about different places and cultures.

I'll be creating a variety of content related to Geoguessr, including tips and tricks for playing the game, challenges and competitions with other players, and live streams of my gameplay. I'm also open to suggestions and ideas from my followers, so feel free to comment on my posts or send me a message with your ideas.

I can't wait to get started and share my Geoguessr adventures with all of you. Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy the new content!

Sincerely,
Wirtual

Daniel Strizhevsky: I did ask it: Make the song sound like Grokoins are a pyramid scheme
Daniel Strizhevsky: But it was quite out in the open with it
Chris Acker: Cryptocurrency Grokoin Revealed to be Pyramid Scheme

The cryptocurrency Grokoin, which was popular among Trackmania enthusiasts, has been exposed as a pyramid scheme. The man behind the scheme, Daniel Striz, is facing a number of serious lawsuits, and billions of dollars have been stolen from investors.

According to reports, Striz and his team, known as "The Grokery", used the hype around Grokoin and Trackmania to lure investors into their scheme. They promised high returns on investments, but in reality, most of the money was being funneled to the top of the pyramid, leaving the vast majority of investors with nothing.

The scheme was uncovered after a group of Trackmania players noticed unusual activity on the Grokoin network and began to investigate. They discovered that Striz and The Grokery were using the cryptocurrency to enrich themselves at the expense of their investors.

Striz and his team have been hit with a number of lawsuits, and The Grokery has been disbanded by authorities. The Grokoin cryptocurrency has been delisted from exchanges, and its value has plummeted.

The case serves as a warning to investors to be cautious of scams and pyramid schemes, especially those that use the hype around popular games and cryptocurrencies to lure in victims. It is always important to do your own research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.

Daniel Strizhevsky: Dear Grokestronauts,

I am writing to update you on the situation with the TrackMania Poop Snacks. As some of you may know, I recently launched this new venture as a way to provide a fun and tasty snack for the Grokestronauts community.

However, I have recently learned that the TrackMania Poop Snacks have been deemed illegal by the FDA for containing literal poop. I want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or harm that I may have caused by promoting and selling these snacks.
Chris Acker: Dear The Grokery,

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment about the TrackMania Poop Snacks. I purchased and ate several of these snacks, and as a result, I have experienced severe stomach pains and other symptoms.

I cannot believe that you would promote and sell a product that contains literal poop, and I am shocked and outraged that the FDA has deemed it illegal. Your actions have caused me harm, and I demand that you take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.

I expect that you will immediately recall the TrackMania Poop Snacks and offer a full refund to all customers who have purchased them. I also expect that you will take steps to ensure that this never happens again, and that you will be more transparent and responsible in the future.

Sincerely,
A sad Grokestronaut

Chris Acker: Dear The Grokery,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the situation regarding the TrackMania Poop Snacks. My partner and I were huge fans of the Grokestronauts community, and when we were expecting our first child, we decided to name him after the snacks.

However, now we are faced with the reality that our son's name is associated with a product that contains literal poop, and that has been deemed illegal by the FDA. We are embarrassed and ashamed that we made this decision, and we deeply regret it.

I expect that you will take full responsibility for the confusion and harm that you have caused by promoting and selling these snacks. I expect that you will offer a full refund to all customers who have purchased the snacks, and that you will take steps to prevent this from happening again in the future.

Sincerely,
Wallace

Angry Crowd: You need to apologize to that family and take responsibility for your actions!

Groke: [Visibly shaken] I-I'm sorry. I will apologize to Wallace and his son. I never meant to cause any harm.

Angry Crowd Member: What's the kid's name anyway? It can't be that bad.

Groke: His name is Blue Loop.

[The crowd erupts into laughter]

Angry Crowd: Blue Loop? That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!
Daniel Strizhevsky: [The crowd starts making fun of Blue Loop, laughing and jeering at Groke]

Groke: [Trying to defend himself] I didn't name him that, it was his parents!

Angry Crowd: That doesn't excuse your behavior! You need to apologize and take responsibility for your actions!

[The footage ends with Groke being berated by the angry crowd]
Chris Acker: lol how did Blue loop come about
Daniel Strizhevsky: It remembered this from something like 15 chats ago
Daniel Strizhevsky: However, I am excited to announce a new venture that I am launching - TrackMania Poop Snacks! These delicious snacks are inspired by the world of TrackMania and are the perfect treat for any Grokestronaut.

Each bag of TrackMania Poop Snacks contains an assortment of tasty flavors, including Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast. They are made from all natural ingredients and are the perfect snack for gaming, streaming, or just enjoying with friends.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I glossed over this part lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Hey Groke,

Dude, I am so hyped about these new TrackMania Poop Snacks! I've been a huge fan of the game since it came out, and I can't wait to try these snacks.

I'm sure they're going to be so tasty, and the different flavors sound amazing. Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast are my favorite tracks in the game, and now I can munch on snacks that taste like them while I'm playing.

I can't wait to get my hands on a bag of these snacks and munch on them while I'm streaming my gameplay. I'm sure all my fans are going to love them too.

Thanks for coming up with such a cool product, Groke!

Sincerely,
A High Fan of TrackMania and Poop Snacks

Chris Acker: INT. GROKERY - DAY

Blue Loop and the high fan of TrackMania Poop Snacks stand face to face, seething with anger. The air is tense and the sound of their heavy breathing fills the room.

BLUE LOOP: You have no right to call yourself a fan of TrackMania. You're just a cheat who uses drugs to give yourself an unfair advantage.

HIGH FAN: And you're just a washed-up has-been who can't handle the competition.

They both take a step forward, ready to throw a punch. But before they can, Daniel Striz bursts into the room.

DANIEL: Stop it, both of you! This isn't the way to settle your differences.

BLUE LOOP: Shut up, Striz. You're the reason we're in this mess.

HIGH FAN: Yeah, if it weren't for your shady business practices, we wouldn't be fighting over a stupid bag of snacks.

DANIEL: I know, I know. I'm sorry. But please, let's just calm down and talk this out like adults.

The two players reluctantly back away from each other, still glowering. Daniel takes a deep breath and starts to speak.

DANIEL: Look, I know I made a huge mistake with the Grokery and the Grokoins. I was blinded by greed and I didn't think about the consequences of my actions. But I promise, I'm going to make things right. I'll pay back everyone who was affected by the pyramid scheme, and I'll shut down the Grokery for good.

BLUE LOOP: And what about the TrackMania Poop Snacks? Are you going to stop selling those too?

DANIEL: Yes, I'll stop selling the snacks. I never should have made them in the first place. It was a foolish idea and I'm sorry for any harm they may have caused.

HIGH FAN: Well, at least you're doing something right for once.

DANIEL: Please, just give me a chance to make things right. I know I can't undo the damage that's been done, but I want to try and make things better.

BLUE LOOP: Fine, we'll give you a chance. But if you mess up again, we won't be so lenient.

DANIEL: Thank you. I promise, I won't let you down.

The three of them stand in silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Then, without another word, they turn and walk out of the room, leaving behind the remnants of the failed Grokery and the ill-fated TrackMania Poop Snacks.

We see a panoramic shot of Grunion Island, a lush, green paradise.

Suddenly, the sound of a tank engine can be heard.

Cut to:

INT. TANK COCKPIT - DAY

We see TRACKMANIAC, a villainous figure with a maniacal grin, driving the tank towards Grunion Island.

Cut to:

INT. GRUNION ISLAND - DAY

We see GROKE, a muscular superhero with a fierce determination in his eyes, standing atop the highest peak on the island.

He hears the tank approaching and takes a deep breath.

GROKE:

(to himself)

Time to save the green onions.

With a mighty leap, Groke soars through the air and lands on the tank.

FADE TO BLACK.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: to sell baba weights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok some updates on internet bill stuff:

We are in a year contract (ending in May). If we break this contract we have to pay $$

Also apparently after our last year contract expired they started charging us an extra $25 a month for renting the equipment -.-

My bad for not noticing sooner :/

Anyway I called them and they gave me a $50 credit back so it is slightly cheaper I guess though still more than $70.

I asked if we can transfer the account to someone else's name cause I'm not even sure if Dan and I will be using xfinity at our next place and they said yeah you can transfer. 

They offered another discount on WiFi etc but only if we renew until Jan 2024 and I was like nah let me discuss with the roommates cause I think you guys can get something cheaper if it will just be the 2 of you. 

Pls let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Also let me know about baba weights
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess we should call our new apartment and ask if they have xfinity? i think they don't right?

Daniel Strizhevsky: Better than most of you I presume? ;)
Chris Acker: I'm glad to see that you're having fun and improving your skills in trackmania. 2,423 points is definitely a good effort, and I'm sure you worked hard to earn those points. However, it's important to remember that trackmania is just a game and there are many other things in life to be proud of. Don't worry about comparing your score to others - just keep having fun and keep working on improving your skills!
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's ok to be a little jealous sirs
Chris Acker: I know it can be tough to see someone else with a higher score, but try not to let it get you down. Every player has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to be at different levels. Keep playing and having fun, and you'll get better over time.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah the dumb blue one
Chris Acker: I'll just use that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Converts into a hand vacuum
Chris Acker: The roomba is going to take too long
Chris Acker: It's going to have to remap the entire apartment because we removed all the furniture that was there when we initially did the mapping
Chris Acker: Not worth
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can just have it go while we're at dinner or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can it map and clean at the same time?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think we'll need it for the carpets
Daniel Strizhevsky: Because the blue one doesn't work on them
Daniel Strizhevsky: (also then we don't have to do anything, it can just do it while we're eating/doing other stuff)
Chris Acker: It took it like two days to learn the mapping last time‚Ä¶
Chris Acker: Let's make this blue one work
Daniel Strizhevsky: Frick we won't be able to clean the carpets then
Chris Acker: Won't they do vacuuming?  They said they'd have cleaners come right
Chris Acker: The cleaners will certainly vacuum
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm just worried if it takes them an extra hour or two then Scott will be more likely to charge us for it
Chris Acker: Nahhh
Chris Acker: They are going to vacuum regardless
Chris Acker: With a good vacuum
Chris Acker: Same surface area

I don't think a rating of 1449 is that good especially since my rating is 1903. That is an entire 454 points higher. As you can see that is no small difference! Which is why I think 1449 is just not that good. Hehe‚Äù
