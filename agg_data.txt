Chris Acker: You set your nickname to Toum.
Chris Acker: You set the nickname for a participant to Groke.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Uhhh sword
Daniel Strizhevsky: Boring
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Zeush aren't you supposedly in a meeting right now
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Then you shouldn't have time to bully me based on my weapon of choice
Daniel Strizhevsky: No I have time
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Fine I will use the sitton
Zach Gospe: Huzzah! 

I think I'll be using either the life staff or the fire staff / ice gauntlet if you want to take life, Dan. Magic is cool üòé üî•üå≤‚ùÑÔ∏è
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker: Actually @Zeush has been playing a lot with the warhammer
Chris Acker: Maybe Dan can be our heavy weight boy
Chris Acker: And Zach can be our magic healer
Chris Acker: And I'll be our spearman
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What about me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You didn't say what I am
Zach Gospe: If chris and Dan are two-handed melee boys, we could probably use another ranged weapon in the party, or maybe a sword and shield.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm undecided still
Daniel Strizhevsky: I wanna try a musket or bow or magic once I get my gaming computer and can aim
Daniel Strizhevsky: Remember everyone gets 2 weapons :)
Daniel Strizhevsky: I might also switch to a rapier
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will do sword and shield
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And then I will try some kind of range weapon
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Maybe a bow and arrow
Zach Gospe: Sheeesh that sounds bussin
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm thinking maybe bow with my war hammer to get that +10% move speed ability
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm gaming if anyone wants to join

Zach Gospe: Looks like I need to acquire a registration code from Moises to create an account
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I asked him if you needed anything and he said you should have something in your email
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If not hit him up and I'll PERSONALLY go down there to ensure a speedy reply lol
Zach Gospe: Lol okay I am not seeing it in my email. I'll follow up with him very nicely, and you can play the bad cop :D
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Groke did he respond or should I bus down there
Zach Gospe: No response yet but let's give him another hour or so in case he was just out to lunch or something
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: Moises responded at 2 that I should be receiving an email about it, but it has not arrived yet. 

I do have a different email from Encore about maintenance requests, so clearly I'm on some list, it's just document signing piece hasn't come through yet.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Alright if it doesn't come in by tomorrow morning I can go down there and inquire
Zach Gospe: Classic Pentagon P rolling in to scout out B site
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Zach Gospe: Moises had to redo the lease, but I was able to sign it now. I believe you all will need to re-sign it though, unfortunately.

Daniel Strizhevsky: as the lease has been signed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Please look at the competitors listing and tell me what your thoughts are about the offer. Our team will be very pleased with renewing your lease for another term!
Daniel Strizhevsky: Does this mean they're open to negotiation?
Chris Acker: Yes it seems like it
Daniel Strizhevsky: We should ask about shorter leases as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: But
Daniel Strizhevsky: These prices are better than I was expecting
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah let's email about shorter leases
Chris Acker: Okay but I don't want to go too short
Chris Acker: Unless we don't like the price and want to move somewhere else
Chris Acker: If we like the price we shouldn't risk having to renegotiate
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah Moises only told us 12 months or month to month lease
Chris Acker: As they might just increase it again
Zach Gospe: Reacted üëç to your message 
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I would like to find out what the prices for 6 month or 8 month lease are
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'll send an email to ask that one

Zach Gospe: I only did 3 for 5/9, but did all four for 5/16. Not sure how to represent that in the Splitwise
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So you would do title 5/9 and then pay each of us a dollar. You don't have to do anything for 5/16
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Splitwise is kinda weird so you will have to make 3 5/9 payments
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So like you will say Chris paid and you owe him a dollar

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello sirs @Toum @Groke
Daniel Strizhevsky: Although samvrutha has tested negative for COVID her sore throat /cough is worsening
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should we get a hotel/airbnb? Or just lock ourselves in our room or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or test again tomorrow morning and see what happens
Chris Acker: Lol Zach is surrounded by covid
Chris Acker: From all angles
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poor snackary
Daniel Strizhevsky: No escape for him
Chris Acker: Zach has a bachelor party to attend this weekend which he's been organizing so I'd say his opinion on the matter comes first
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky: Holy cow the famous party is this weekend!?!
Chris Acker: In my case, the less important case, I'm okay if you guys just quarantine in your room and wear masks when exiting/entering
Chris Acker: Maybe get doordash and such instead of spending time cooking in the kitchen and touching things?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah that sounds reasonable, let's wait and see what @Groke thinks. We can also get a hotel until Zach's event
Zach Gospe: My bachelor party unfortunately just got canceled due to Covid unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ü•∫
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Can Dan spread it if he's immune after having it?
Chris Acker: Wouldn't his super-immune white blood cells just destroy that business?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: I recommend giving the kitchen a quick scrub down cause I was in there earlier today
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And maybe opening up the windows in the living room to air it out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Sounds good to me
Daniel Strizhevsky: And we'll test samvrutha again tomorrow
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should I buy some paper plates for me and samvrutha to use?
Daniel Strizhevsky: So that we can just throw it out directly

Daniel Strizhevsky: But tbh I think it's fine to do tomorrow morning
Zach Gospe: Okay sounds good. I am in the middle of verifying my bank account with them so I can't pay directly without a fee anyway at the moment.

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Daniel Strizhevsky: Does Dhruv know sarin doesn't like him
Chris Acker: Yeah but he probably thinks if he can get over it than Sarin can
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: Hmmm I might offer to do half the trip with dhruv and then join you guys later or something

Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is a big predicament indeed!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Are you still going to buy flights with us

Chris Acker: It would just change possibly accommodations and destinations along the way
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ah ok ok so maybe you start with us split off for a bit and then rejoin?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol are you guys gonna go to literally the same countries and cities üòÇ
Chris Acker: I imagine I'd meet Dhruv at Heathrow and we'd go our separate ways lol

Daniel Strizhevsky: Agree with this question
Zach Gospe: My throat is in lots of pain, but the fever is much lower now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: That's good! Do you feel you are on the up and up now

Daniel Strizhevsky: You are welcome
Zach Gospe: Hello and welcome to today's episode of Zach Addresses Current Health, or Z.A.C.H. for short. 

Day 10 after symptoms. Though my symptoms have greatly improved and the fever has been gone for 4 days, I retain slight congestion and a very mild cough. I am testing positive on the at-home antigen tests still. 

While the CDC doubts I am very contagious given these circumstances, I will continue to wear my mask and mostly isolate in my room for this evening and likely tomorrow as well.

Thank you for listening. Please address any questions about Z.A.C.H. to your local congressperson.
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: Thank you Zach for today's Z.A.C.H.
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: I hope your mild congestion and cough subside soon so you may return to being a Happy Zachary once more
Zach Gospe: Thank you for the kind words. I hope so as well. Being a Congested Zachary makes it impossible to be a Happy Zachary, as I can only have one adjective active at a time.

Zach Gospe: Hello and welcome to today's Zach Addresses Current Health and Recalls Yesterday, otherwise known as Z.A.C.H.A.R.Y. 

I am continuing to experience a very mild cough and have tested positive for again on the antigen test. As it is day 11, it is very unlikely that I am contagious. Yet, I will continue to mask and remain mostly isolated today. 

I will plan to isolate again tomorrow, but will likely leave my bubble on Friday unless anyone feels uncomfortable with that.

I have developed a mild fever today but it might be getting worse ü•∫.  I'll take quarantining precautions, and I advise you to wear masks
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Uh oh
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Do you need a covid test?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also let us know if you need us to pick up food or medicine for you from the store!
Chris Acker: I have two with me
Daniel Strizhevsky: Holy cow
Chris Acker: Should I take one now or wait a bit
Daniel Strizhevsky: Had the Zacharias spread
Zach Gospe: Oh no sir please let us know the result of your Covid test. I am very sorry to hear of this development
Chris Acker: Not sure if it's Zach's or not
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Could also be from the flight
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Considering we were around a lot of people
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And Zach has been hardly seen for the past few days
Chris Acker: Yeah we had two long flights back, and navigated 3 airports
Chris Acker: So could be either I guess
Zach Gospe: It has only been two days since you got back so it seems pretty quick for it to be from me. But certainly possible since we share that bathroom
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Yeah it would be a bit quick
Daniel Strizhevsky: Were you near any Sketchy People last flight?
Chris Acker: Lol I don't think so
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I thought I heard a child or two cough on our flight
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Children are vectors of disease
Zach Gospe reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: Yeah I heard that as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: -samvrutha 2022
Chris Acker: We did wear masks on that flight but
Chris Acker: Maybe wasn't enough
Chris Acker: If no one minds I might turn the thermostat down a bit to help with fever
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes do what you need to get better

Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Though I guess technically Zach is safe?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Door to the outside*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Unless Chris has a European strain or pulls a samvrutha and has the flu instead
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes outside door or window lol
Zach Gospe: I am not going to assume I'm safe
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: I may go to my parents actually so Chris you can have your own bathroom
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: That might be a good idea
Chris Acker: Thanks buh
Daniel Strizhevsky: I've learned my lesson from assuming I'm safe last time
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Christopher do you have any high quality n95/kn95 masks
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can get some to you if not
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do we still have Wipey Boys?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can get some of those as well if not
Daniel Strizhevsky: Samvrutha and I can go on an after-work cvs run for any Needs
Zach Gospe: Also I highly recommend NyQuil at night and ibuprofen or Tylenol every six hours (except when taking NyQuil)
Zach Gospe: Do not be fooled by the fever being mild at first if this is Covid. Medicate early and don't fall into my mistakes lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: We have a bottle of Mucinex and half a bottle of butter
Daniel Strizhevsky: NyQuil
Daniel Strizhevsky: And some Emergen-C packets
Chris Acker: I have kn95s
Chris Acker: Zach has put wipeys in our bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: I will bring these medications to your door

Daniel Strizhevsky: Items will be on your right upon exiting the door
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah
Chris Acker: Ty ty
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My doctor said you can also alternate between Tylenol and Advil because one is processed by kidney and one by your liver
Samvrutha Tumuluru: When I had a fever I was close to the Tylenol daily limit so knowing that would have helped greatly
Zach Gospe: Drink many liquids as well @Chris Acker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How are you feeling @Christopher
Chris Acker: Much better now.  But that might just be the ibuprofen I took 3 hrs ago
Chris Acker: Currently I am at 98.6 degrees F
Daniel Strizhevsky: Very good, a respectful temperature
Chris Acker: I have tested positive with the covid
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ

Daniel Strizhevsky: Very good
Chris Acker: I assume you guys are still feeling good?
Daniel Strizhevsky: So far yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yup!
Zach Gospe: Toum any other symptoms going on beyond that fever?
Chris Acker: My throat is a bit scratchy now but otherwise it's just the fever.
Chris Acker: Although the ibuprofen seems to be taking care of the fever as I'm currently at 98.4
Chris Acker: How is your cough grokey
Zach Gospe: Okay sounds really similar to my experience so far.

Chris Acker: Did he look displeased about the fan
Chris Acker: Did he give it a look that said ‚Äúwait haven't I seen this on Amazon for $17 dollars‚Äù
Daniel Strizhevsky: Unfortunately he did not say that
Daniel Strizhevsky: To be fair I think the Amazon one is +$5 shipping
Chris Acker: To be fair it's usually 19.99
Daniel Strizhevsky: But on target it is 17 with no shipping
Daniel Strizhevsky: Cost

Chris Acker: So I wasn't testing
Chris Acker: Are you testing negative now?
Zach Gospe: Yeah a positive test doesn't necessarily mean you're contagious, but a negative test means you definitely aren't.
Zach Gospe: I am testing negative now
Zach Gospe: From what I read, there is a chance you're still contagious from day 10-14 if you are testing positive still. After day 14 if you test positive it's like a fraction of a percent chance you can spread it still

Zach Gospe: The One Party to Rule Them All
(Keep it secret, keep it safe)

Dearest friend,

You are cordially invited to a long-awaited party: a Lord of the Rings extended edition marathon from noon to midnight on Saturday, October 8th. Themed cocktails will be provided at key moments and all other moments as well. Feel free to arrive with a fellowship of your choosing (invite whoever you want).

Like a wizard, please arrive precisely when you mean to (read: feel free to pop in whenever!). Actually watching the movies is not required, there will be plenty else to do, including mingling, drinking, games, and general party shenanigans.

Location: 855 Veterans Blvd, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA. Apartment 502 (and the roof). Step inside and be the farthest from the shire you've ever been, Mr. Frodo. 

What to expect:
* The Lord of the Rings extended edition for extended fun
* 12 hours of Orc ASMR
* (Lord of the) Ring pops
* Magnificent views of the beautiful Redwood City skyline to rival Rivendell
* Chris and Zach drinking every time Frodo looks like he's about to cry

What not to expect:
* Campfire songs with Ed Sheeran
* Dumbledore (that'll be the next party)
* Samvrutha and Dan actually watching Lord of the Rings
* Zach and Chris actually not watching Lord or the Rings
* Cats (no one is bringing a cat)
* Loans
* Someone stealing your sweet roll

Chris Acker: Ok
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 3 people in that wine group have seen the message 0 have responded at all
Zach Gospe: I bet they are checking their calendar still
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is bad
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is really bad
Chris Acker: lol lol lol
Zach Gospe: Or maybe they are setting up a separate group chat with all of them to check if anyone else is going. And then they'll agree it's all worth it and decide to sign up all at once in like 2 days
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ

Chris Acker: Does he work for capital one or something
Chris Acker: I have three mutual friends with him
Chris Acker: One from Vanderbilt and two from capital one
Zach Gospe: Maybe? I know he doesn't work there now though. I think he used to live in Virginia roughly where you used to live so maybe that's why.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Another slightly less gimmicky idea

Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be respectfully declining to dress up but will support others fully in the dressing
Zach Gospe: What if we get you a very smol thing to wear?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'd consider it under these conditions:
1) It's small enough I wouldn't feel bad about throwing it out
2) it's not made of plastic so I don't feel bad about throwing it out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: For example I would be ok with a paper hat
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or paper wand
Zach Gospe: Deal. What if it's something that you don't throw out because I could keep it after
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah if it is something you would be interested in keeping and thus it doesn't get thrown out at all then I would also be ok with that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Anyone else having internet troubles?

Daniel Strizhevsky: Wah wah wah
Daniel Strizhevsky: @everyone any rice today?

Daniel Strizhevsky: And @Christopher?
Zach Gospe: Chris what was your time on track 1
Chris Acker: 18.185
Zach Gospe: Frick that's good
Zach Gospe: Did you save the replay?
Zach Gospe: I am at 18.4
Zach Gospe: Hello folks quick health checkin. 

I still have a bit of a sore throat and a cough, but in terms of energy levels and such I feel basically normal. My plan for today is to finish up work and then sleep as much as possible to make sure I'm okay for the party tomorrow.
Zach Gospe: Are you all okay to pitch in for some of the remaining party prep? Such as cleaning the apartment, acquiring snacks and remaining ingredients for drinks, and double checking we can play the extended edition movies?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Samvrutha and I have acquired some Snacks. I'm assuming we'll order pizza or something of the Ilk during the party as well?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes the snacks are covered we bought sweet and salty snacks at Joes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Are you sure you'll be recovered in time for this party?

Chris Acker: Thx tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: Freezer boy
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ùì
Chris Acker: But naaaa
Zach Gospe: Hello lady and gents we have good movement in symptoms but still much work to do. 

Sore throat is easing up and the dry, unproductive cough is setting in. This is a good step and means I am in the last stage of contagion.

My nose is becoming runny instead of congested as well which also means that things are easing up. 

I shall continue to rotate between eating, drinking, and sleeping and keep you updated.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Should we consider cancelling??
Chris Acker: ^^ good question
Chris Acker: If yur not there I think we should cancel, so it's a question of how last minute it is
Zach Gospe: This is the only weekend we can have this party right?
Daniel Strizhevsky: In theory we could have it next weekend when yuta is here? Idk
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true though if people would still be available is the question
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also would we want to do a 12 hour thing with one of babas 2 days here is also an open question
Chris Acker: Yah in the worse case we could do it when yuta is here
Zach Gospe: I think a good portion of my friends who could make it tomorrow and are bringing other people will be in Tahoe next weekend
Zach Gospe: So the yuta weekend is a no go in terms of turnout I would guess
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm gonna order toilet paper on Doordash
Zach Gospe: So close but yet so far. After 12 hours of sleeping I still have the last little bit of a sore throat. I'm going to begin the cancellation process of the party
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Zach Gospe: Rip
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Rip
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok I will message people
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Zach Gospe will you post on the FB?
Zach Gospe: I have cancelled the fb event with a little note
Zach Gospe: I have then proceeded to text a bunch of folks
Zach Gospe: Any contribution to the communication situation would be lovely
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Wait what is the message
Chris Acker: Are we trying to do this next week or cancelled indefinitely?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just said cancelled cause roommate is sick
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Did not mention any future plans
Zach Gospe: I said we were hoping to reschedule at some point and I'd let people know if/when that happens
Zach Gospe: The message is roommate is sick
Zach Gospe: For people who knew I was already sick early this week I said I'm still sick, and I also added that one of you was also feeling sick so back me up on that white lie if anyone mentions it :)
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Zach Gospe: Gotta protect the reputation ya feel?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: lol you still feeling sick wasn't enough?
Chris Acker: I'll back you up buh
Zach Gospe reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: I basically didn't want to tell certain people that my roommates didn't feel comfy hosting the party without me
Chris Acker: oh ok
Chris Acker: OK so heres an idea: What if we just host a normal party when yuta is here this coming weekend (as I assume Yuta, Daniel, and Samvrutha don't really care about the LOTR theme), which can be smaller scale, and then you and I can do the LOTR party later without the afformentioned.  Then Yuta could also invite the friends he wants to see
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Should we ask him first if he is interested
Zach Gospe: There's still a bunch of people who wouldn't be able to make next weekend on my end but that's probably okay if we're doing a smaller party
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Zach Gospe: Let's ask yuta and see what he says
Chris Acker: Yeah no problem
Chris Acker: @Zach Gospe yuta has given us the GO AHEAD on the party
Zach Gospe: Okay that bustling
Zach Gospe: I‚Äòll send out invites once I am no longer sick

Zach Gospe: Lovely Ty
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello sirs! My friend Jerry Li in the apartment very close by to us is hosting a poker night this Friday
Daniel Strizhevsky: Anyone want to join me in joining the poker night? $50 buy in I think
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: I'm scared
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Me too
Chris Acker: It is my right as an American to be so üá∫üá∏
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: No
Daniel Strizhevsky: Think of it as a $50 fee to play a fun game for a few hours, with a chance of magically receiving some money
Daniel Strizhevsky: Then there is no fear
Chris Acker: But as I know nothing about poker I have little chance of receiving it
Chris Acker: And I know really know any of the attendees
Daniel Strizhevsky: Me neither
Daniel Strizhevsky: To both of those
Chris Acker: So it's like paging 50 to sit at a table with strangers
Daniel Strizhevsky: Frick yeah
Chris Acker: Then what is your reason for attending lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Cause poker is fun
Chris Acker: Really??????
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Zach Gospe: Do we have a guest list and are they cool people / are they really good at poker?
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's Jerry who I know from Robinhood, and possibly Minh who you all met at the party
Daniel Strizhevsky: Others I don't know
Daniel Strizhevsky: No idea how good they are at poker either
Daniel Strizhevsky: Minh will be there confirmed
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just remembered I have an offsite on Friday
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I will be doing stuff
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Offsite onsite
Daniel Strizhevsky: You can come after
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I just remembered after the offsite is dinner
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok mainly it's like $50 must mean these people are really good at poker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like $20 that's a regular joe shmow
Samvrutha Tumuluru: $50 is like yeah I play often and seriously
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Can I cash out at anytime?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: For example $50 buy in but then when I lose $20 I quit and just hang out instead?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think as long as you don't do that in like the first 10 mins it's fine
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How much is big blind
Daniel Strizhevsky: Blinds are $0.25/$0.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think as people get older and richer the $10 games of yesteryear are gone
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jerry said yeah it's buy-in whatever buy-out whatever anytime you want
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So I can buy in with only $15 if I want
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or perhaps even $10
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe but you'd be at a huge disadvantage
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Cause people could crush me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also I have another question
Daniel Strizhevsky: Just buy in 50 and cash out when you hit 35 or something
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Could I come and just hang out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And like be a silent observer on your team
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or is that not allowed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee
Daniel Strizhevsky: But
Daniel Strizhevsky: I don't trust your poker face
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jerry will also be providing board games
Daniel Strizhevsky: In case you guys decide not to play
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok I am more interested now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will still play it by ear based on how tired I am
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But this is more enticing
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'm so sleepy
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Wrong chat

Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevsky lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol what are the financial experts arguments
Chris Acker: I think it's because if you take it in cash, you only get $597 million
Chris Acker: That's before taxes
Chris Acker: You only get the full 1.2 billion if you take it over time
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: It would be the same as taking the cash and then making an average of 4.3% in the markets every year for 30 years
Chris Acker: So if you think you can do better than that, you should take the cash, otherwise, take the annuity
Chris Acker: Basically, I think powerball itself wants to invest the cash, and they would take a cut of the investment return, but guarantee you the 1.6 billion, using their earnings from ticket sales as collateral
Chris Acker: If you took the cash now, you could possibly do better in the markets overtime, but you have no guarantee
Daniel Strizhevsky: Interesting I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: If any Ricetophers are making rice, I'd like one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Zach Gospe are you ok!

I did just have Covid two months ago so I'm hoping I'm safe, though with my other health issues lingering I wouldn't be surprised if my immune system isn't great at the moment. Will keep you updated. 

Would you all like me to quarantine for now?
Chris Acker: While you are probably safe I'll be seeing my fam in a few days so quarantining until I am gone would be appreciated

Zach Gospe: Can do, good sir
Zach Gospe: I'll make sure to wipe down the bathroom throughly with each use
Chris Acker: I hope your mom is okay though

Zach Gospe: I will be masked in the kitchen making some food in a moment please be advised
Zach Gospe: Still testing negative for the Rona. I also have a doctor appt tomorrow so will keep you updated then.

Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris, I'm impressed that you've reached 7000 campaign points in Trackmania, but I think you have the potential to do even better. Why don't you try to increase your score and see how high you can go?" This approach encourages Chris to continue playing and improving his skills in order to reach a higher level of success in the game.

Daniel Strizhevsky: "Hey Chris, I noticed that you only have 7000 campaign points in Trackmania. Don't you think it's time to step up your game and join the ranks of the over 9000 campaign point club like the rest of us?"
Daniel Strizhevsky: Would you say this statement conveys my frustration your lack of progress in the game, while also providing a gentle nudge for you to improve your skills and progress further in the game?
Chris Acker: I know that you're really proud of your campaign points in Trackmania, but I wanted to let you know that they don't necessarily reflect your skill as a player. Campaign points are just a way to measure progress through the game's single-player content, and they don't take into account factors like your speed, precision, and overall racing ability. So don't get too caught up in your campaign points
Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris, I know that you're a great player in Trackmania, but campaign points are the most important metric of success in the game. They take into account your speed, precision, and overall skill level, and they're the best way to compare your performance to other players. So, if you want to be considered one of the best players in the game, you need to focus on earning as many campaign points as possible.
Chris Acker: Dear fans and followers,

I am excited to announce that I will be starting a new series on my YouTube channel, GeoWizard Plays Trackmania! As many of you know, I am a geography enthusiast and I love sharing my knowledge and passion for the world around us with all of you.

Recently, I have developed a love for the game Trackmania, and I am excited to share my experiences with you. Trackmania is a fast-paced and challenging racing game that offers a unique and exciting gameplay experience. I can't wait to dive in and start playing, and I hope you will join me on this new adventure.

Stay tuned for more updates and information about my new series, and I hope you will join me on my channel as I explore the world of Trackmania.

Sincerely,
GeoWizard

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hi everyone,

I'm excited to announce that I will be starting to play Geoguessr and creating lots of related content on my channel. I've been a huge fan of this game for a while now, and I can't wait to share my adventures and challenges with you all.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Geoguessr, it's a fun and exciting game that challenges players to guess the location of a randomly generated street view from around the world. It's a great way to test your geography skills and learn about different places and cultures.

I'll be creating a variety of content related to Geoguessr, including tips and tricks for playing the game, challenges and competitions with other players, and live streams of my gameplay. I'm also open to suggestions and ideas from my followers, so feel free to comment on my posts or send me a message with your ideas.

I can't wait to get started and share my Geoguessr adventures with all of you. Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy the new content!

Sincerely,
Wirtual

Daniel Strizhevsky: I did ask it: Make the song sound like Grokoins are a pyramid scheme
Daniel Strizhevsky: But it was quite out in the open with it
Chris Acker: Cryptocurrency Grokoin Revealed to be Pyramid Scheme

The cryptocurrency Grokoin, which was popular among Trackmania enthusiasts, has been exposed as a pyramid scheme. The man behind the scheme, Daniel Striz, is facing a number of serious lawsuits, and billions of dollars have been stolen from investors.

According to reports, Striz and his team, known as "The Grokery", used the hype around Grokoin and Trackmania to lure investors into their scheme. They promised high returns on investments, but in reality, most of the money was being funneled to the top of the pyramid, leaving the vast majority of investors with nothing.

The scheme was uncovered after a group of Trackmania players noticed unusual activity on the Grokoin network and began to investigate. They discovered that Striz and The Grokery were using the cryptocurrency to enrich themselves at the expense of their investors.

Striz and his team have been hit with a number of lawsuits, and The Grokery has been disbanded by authorities. The Grokoin cryptocurrency has been delisted from exchanges, and its value has plummeted.

The case serves as a warning to investors to be cautious of scams and pyramid schemes, especially those that use the hype around popular games and cryptocurrencies to lure in victims. It is always important to do your own research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.

Daniel Strizhevsky: Dear Grokestronauts,

I am writing to update you on the situation with the TrackMania Poop Snacks. As some of you may know, I recently launched this new venture as a way to provide a fun and tasty snack for the Grokestronauts community.

However, I have recently learned that the TrackMania Poop Snacks have been deemed illegal by the FDA for containing literal poop. I want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or harm that I may have caused by promoting and selling these snacks.
Chris Acker: Dear The Grokery,

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment about the TrackMania Poop Snacks. I purchased and ate several of these snacks, and as a result, I have experienced severe stomach pains and other symptoms.

I cannot believe that you would promote and sell a product that contains literal poop, and I am shocked and outraged that the FDA has deemed it illegal. Your actions have caused me harm, and I demand that you take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.

I expect that you will immediately recall the TrackMania Poop Snacks and offer a full refund to all customers who have purchased them. I also expect that you will take steps to ensure that this never happens again, and that you will be more transparent and responsible in the future.

Sincerely,
A sad Grokestronaut

Chris Acker: Dear The Grokery,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the situation regarding the TrackMania Poop Snacks. My partner and I were huge fans of the Grokestronauts community, and when we were expecting our first child, we decided to name him after the snacks.

However, now we are faced with the reality that our son's name is associated with a product that contains literal poop, and that has been deemed illegal by the FDA. We are embarrassed and ashamed that we made this decision, and we deeply regret it.

I expect that you will take full responsibility for the confusion and harm that you have caused by promoting and selling these snacks. I expect that you will offer a full refund to all customers who have purchased the snacks, and that you will take steps to prevent this from happening again in the future.

Sincerely,
Wallace

Angry Crowd: You need to apologize to that family and take responsibility for your actions!

Groke: [Visibly shaken] I-I'm sorry. I will apologize to Wallace and his son. I never meant to cause any harm.

Angry Crowd Member: What's the kid's name anyway? It can't be that bad.

Groke: His name is Blue Loop.

[The crowd erupts into laughter]

Angry Crowd: Blue Loop? That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!
Daniel Strizhevsky: [The crowd starts making fun of Blue Loop, laughing and jeering at Groke]

Groke: [Trying to defend himself] I didn't name him that, it was his parents!

Angry Crowd: That doesn't excuse your behavior! You need to apologize and take responsibility for your actions!

[The footage ends with Groke being berated by the angry crowd]
Chris Acker: lol how did Blue loop come about
Daniel Strizhevsky: It remembered this from something like 15 chats ago
Daniel Strizhevsky: However, I am excited to announce a new venture that I am launching - TrackMania Poop Snacks! These delicious snacks are inspired by the world of TrackMania and are the perfect treat for any Grokestronaut.

Each bag of TrackMania Poop Snacks contains an assortment of tasty flavors, including Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast. They are made from all natural ingredients and are the perfect snack for gaming, streaming, or just enjoying with friends.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I glossed over this part lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Hey Groke,

Dude, I am so hyped about these new TrackMania Poop Snacks! I've been a huge fan of the game since it came out, and I can't wait to try these snacks.

I'm sure they're going to be so tasty, and the different flavors sound amazing. Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast are my favorite tracks in the game, and now I can munch on snacks that taste like them while I'm playing.

I can't wait to get my hands on a bag of these snacks and munch on them while I'm streaming my gameplay. I'm sure all my fans are going to love them too.

Thanks for coming up with such a cool product, Groke!

Sincerely,
A High Fan of TrackMania and Poop Snacks

Chris Acker: INT. GROKERY - DAY

Blue Loop and the high fan of TrackMania Poop Snacks stand face to face, seething with anger. The air is tense and the sound of their heavy breathing fills the room.

BLUE LOOP: You have no right to call yourself a fan of TrackMania. You're just a cheat who uses drugs to give yourself an unfair advantage.

HIGH FAN: And you're just a washed-up has-been who can't handle the competition.

They both take a step forward, ready to throw a punch. But before they can, Daniel Striz bursts into the room.

DANIEL: Stop it, both of you! This isn't the way to settle your differences.

BLUE LOOP: Shut up, Striz. You're the reason we're in this mess.

HIGH FAN: Yeah, if it weren't for your shady business practices, we wouldn't be fighting over a stupid bag of snacks.

DANIEL: I know, I know. I'm sorry. But please, let's just calm down and talk this out like adults.

The two players reluctantly back away from each other, still glowering. Daniel takes a deep breath and starts to speak.

DANIEL: Look, I know I made a huge mistake with the Grokery and the Grokoins. I was blinded by greed and I didn't think about the consequences of my actions. But I promise, I'm going to make things right. I'll pay back everyone who was affected by the pyramid scheme, and I'll shut down the Grokery for good.

BLUE LOOP: And what about the TrackMania Poop Snacks? Are you going to stop selling those too?

DANIEL: Yes, I'll stop selling the snacks. I never should have made them in the first place. It was a foolish idea and I'm sorry for any harm they may have caused.

HIGH FAN: Well, at least you're doing something right for once.

DANIEL: Please, just give me a chance to make things right. I know I can't undo the damage that's been done, but I want to try and make things better.

BLUE LOOP: Fine, we'll give you a chance. But if you mess up again, we won't be so lenient.

DANIEL: Thank you. I promise, I won't let you down.

The three of them stand in silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Then, without another word, they turn and walk out of the room, leaving behind the remnants of the failed Grokery and the ill-fated TrackMania Poop Snacks.

We see a panoramic shot of Grunion Island, a lush, green paradise.

Suddenly, the sound of a tank engine can be heard.

Cut to:

INT. TANK COCKPIT - DAY

We see TRACKMANIAC, a villainous figure with a maniacal grin, driving the tank towards Grunion Island.

Cut to:

INT. GRUNION ISLAND - DAY

We see GROKE, a muscular superhero with a fierce determination in his eyes, standing atop the highest peak on the island.

He hears the tank approaching and takes a deep breath.

GROKE:

(to himself)

Time to save the green onions.

With a mighty leap, Groke soars through the air and lands on the tank.

FADE TO BLACK.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: to sell baba weights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok some updates on internet bill stuff:

We are in a year contract (ending in May). If we break this contract we have to pay $$

Also apparently after our last year contract expired they started charging us an extra $25 a month for renting the equipment -.-

My bad for not noticing sooner :/

Anyway I called them and they gave me a $50 credit back so it is slightly cheaper I guess though still more than $70.

I asked if we can transfer the account to someone else's name cause I'm not even sure if Dan and I will be using xfinity at our next place and they said yeah you can transfer. 

They offered another discount on WiFi etc but only if we renew until Jan 2024 and I was like nah let me discuss with the roommates cause I think you guys can get something cheaper if it will just be the 2 of you. 

Pls let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Also let me know about baba weights
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess we should call our new apartment and ask if they have xfinity? i think they don't right?

Daniel Strizhevsky: Better than most of you I presume? ;)
Chris Acker: I'm glad to see that you're having fun and improving your skills in trackmania. 2,423 points is definitely a good effort, and I'm sure you worked hard to earn those points. However, it's important to remember that trackmania is just a game and there are many other things in life to be proud of. Don't worry about comparing your score to others - just keep having fun and keep working on improving your skills!
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's ok to be a little jealous sirs
Chris Acker: I know it can be tough to see someone else with a higher score, but try not to let it get you down. Every player has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to be at different levels. Keep playing and having fun, and you'll get better over time.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah the dumb blue one
Chris Acker: I'll just use that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Converts into a hand vacuum
Chris Acker: The roomba is going to take too long
Chris Acker: It's going to have to remap the entire apartment because we removed all the furniture that was there when we initially did the mapping
Chris Acker: Not worth
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can just have it go while we're at dinner or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can it map and clean at the same time?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think we'll need it for the carpets
Daniel Strizhevsky: Because the blue one doesn't work on them
Daniel Strizhevsky: (also then we don't have to do anything, it can just do it while we're eating/doing other stuff)
Chris Acker: It took it like two days to learn the mapping last time‚Ä¶
Chris Acker: Let's make this blue one work
Daniel Strizhevsky: Frick we won't be able to clean the carpets then
Chris Acker: Won't they do vacuuming?  They said they'd have cleaners come right
Chris Acker: The cleaners will certainly vacuum
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm just worried if it takes them an extra hour or two then Scott will be more likely to charge us for it
Chris Acker: Nahhh
Chris Acker: They are going to vacuum regardless
Chris Acker: With a good vacuum
Chris Acker: Same surface area

I don't think a rating of 1449 is that good especially since my rating is 1903. That is an entire 454 points higher. As you can see that is no small difference! Which is why I think 1449 is just not that good. Hehe‚Äù

Yuta Baba: I want to invest in VCs that have private companies about to go public
Daniel Strizhevsky: isn't investing in early stage startups already high risk lol
Yuta Baba: Like discord Robinhood sofi

Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: So that means the time to buy Airbnb and DoorDash is around the corner
Daniel Strizhevsky: isnt it priced in
Yuta Baba: Hype just pushed it to the extreme
Yuta Baba: And when insiders can sell stocks the price falls
Yuta Baba: Like a lot
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs my observation with a sample 1
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk everyone knows when the lockup expires
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i feel like it's mostly priced in
Yuta Baba: Exactly I mean for snowflake the first lockup expired on 12/15 so the price went up up up and reached the peak a week before and tanked
Yuta Baba: So by the time employees got to seek some stocks it was already way lower than the peak
Daniel Strizhevsky: when @Chris Acker bought in :)
Yuta Baba reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: LOL
Yuta Baba: Sad
Yuta Baba: There‚Äôs a meme for the guy who bought SNOW at 319, which is the highest price on the IPO date and 4XX which is the peak

Yuta Baba: Wait what happened

Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm confused about electricity?
Chris Acker: @Samvrutha Tumuluru can you just try signing in by going to encore's website and going to the resident portal?
Chris Acker: I didn't use any code...
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba we have to set up an electricity account with PG&E, which is a company that supplies most of california's electricity.  We will pay them for electricity directly rather than going through Encore
Chris Acker: And we also need to buy renters insurance
Chris Acker: Which is insurance that takes effect in case we destroy anything, or things are damaged in case of flooding or fire, etc
Chris Acker: Pretty much all apartments require that you have insurance
Yuta Baba: Did u buy this to live in metropolitan
Chris Acker: yes, and all the previous apartments i have lived in
Yuta Baba: Oh okay
Yuta Baba: Any recs on the company?
Chris Acker: Who did we do it through before @Daniel Strizhevsky@Samvrutha Tumuluru?
Chris Acker: Lemonade or something?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: yeah lemonade
Samvrutha Tumuluru: oh nvm
Samvrutha Tumuluru: it was their included insurance
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll do some research this weekend but lemonade was like 11 bucks
Daniel Strizhevsky: is there insurance they include with this place?
Daniel Strizhevsky: if so, let's just do that. if not, let's just do lemonade
Daniel Strizhevsky: i have a soft spot for fintech startups

Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is very long
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I can not read all of it tonight
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Will finish signing tomorrow
Yuta Baba: I actually enojoyed reading some of it
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We must return the apartment in the same state of cleanliness that we got it in
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Any cleaning costs will be billed 100% to us
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Hopefully they don‚Äôt try to screw us over like metropolitan did
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Cleaning is separate from normal wear and tear
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have a worryingly long section on bedbugs
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No drones allowed in the common areas Strizhevsky. Hope that‚Äôs not a dealbreaker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I don‚Äôt know how they would regulate this but they say you can only have overnight guests for at most 7 nights per month
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And no more than 2 overnight guests at a time
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They also dedicated more than a page to talking about mold
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I feel like they‚Äôve had to fumigate for bedbugs or something before
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The last page is saying the building has been treated with pesticides
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Anyway I completed signing so @Daniel Strizhevsky the gate of the universe rests on your shoulders
Yuta Baba: Is this 7 nights for each person? Or per room
Yuta Baba: I couldn‚Äôt tell from the agreement but I signed it anyway lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a gif.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Now that we have all signed the lease are they going to send us anything?
Yuta Baba: They are waiting for these
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to do the renters insurance and PG&E tonight?
Yuta Baba: Sure
Chris Acker: What does it mean by bring a copy of a government issued ID
Chris Acker: Does that mean we need to make a copy and give it to them
Yuta Baba: Take a copy of a driving license
Yuta Baba: Yes
Chris Acker: Or we just need to show it on arrival
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you think it's $100k total in personal liability coverage? or each
Chris Acker: I would assume it‚Äôs total
Daniel Strizhevsky: peepoo peepoo. i guess we should ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: as it will affect or Lemons
Chris Acker: We should also consider whether we want to get a joint policy, or all get our own
Chris Acker: I read that using a joint policy can come with ‚Äúcomplexities‚Äù
Daniel Strizhevsky: i've previously used individual policies, don't really know about joint policies. i think it may have been cheaper to do individual
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah joint can be p complicated I agree
Yuta Baba: One time I did a joint phone bill and it was a mess

Daniel Strizhevsky: surely you rentees aren't paying for it???
Chris Acker: No the homeowner has insurance
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok good
Daniel Strizhevsky: this makes me feel better about our decision to choose an apartment and not a house
Daniel Strizhevsky: how much do you have to be involved in all hte fixing
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm not sure how involved  i had to be, but I am currently the most involved lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: sad
Chris Acker: Our rental company organized the cleaners, plumbers, etc, and I‚Äôve spent all day ‚Äúsupervising‚Äù them
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky: did you tell your roommates you're moving out btw
Chris Acker: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: It sucks because it‚Äôs difficult to sell my room when this is happening
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah this seems quite unfortunate :(
Daniel Strizhevsky: is the other room still pending
Chris Acker: No we got a dude from Tesla to take that
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker: On the way here, his flight got delayed twice, then he missed it the third time, and when we finally got here, he locked himself out of his room.  So we had to call a locksmith to get him in. But the locksmith couldn‚Äôt fix the lock so he just broke the knob off.  So now he is knobless.  And then this happened like the next day.  I was yelling at him to keep bailing water and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired üòû ‚Äú and I‚Äôm like KEEP BAILING‚Äù
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: And now the house is destroyed
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh man that is quite a sad time for tesla man
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lolololol
Chris Acker: Yeah he probably hates us by this point lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I‚Äôm just imagining like it‚Äôs you and this dude on a small boat in the ocean
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And you tell him to keep bailing water
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad move in time for him though
Chris Acker: BAIILLLLLLLLL
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: man deserves 1 day free rent
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe even 1.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Chris Acker: Yeah and now that I‚Äôm leaving if they don‚Äôt find a person (and it will be difficult to find a person in this situation) the other guys will likely have to share the cost of my rent
Chris Acker: And this Tesla guy already had to pay 250 for the locksmith
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: man couldn't unlock the door and still charged 250???
Chris Acker: And he‚Äôs just an intern so he got this room so that he could live cheaply lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also like
Daniel Strizhevsky: shouldn't more of this be on the landlord to like
Daniel Strizhevsky: deal with
Chris Acker: I think that included the new knob, but the landlord will probably pay him back for that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol to be fair man locked himself out of his own room
Chris Acker: Yeah it was weird
Chris Acker: Because his doorknob had the same kind of lock that is there on an outside door
Chris Acker: Like the door that leads into your house
Chris Acker: Usually doors on the inside just have a little hole right
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Chris Acker: So he assumed that the house key also worked for his door
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: It did not
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait so like
Daniel Strizhevsky: it's just a not-unlockable door??
Chris Acker: And no one knew where the actual key was because this house is 60 years old
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh wow
Chris Acker: You can lock/unlock it from the inside
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also locksmith sounds like he isn‚Äôt that good though
Chris Acker: Cuz there is just a twisty thing like normal
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like aren‚Äôt most locks just deterrents
Chris Acker: The lock was so old that the pins were rusted
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: So he couldn‚Äôt use the usual tricks
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm not even sure if the key would have worked
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm sure LockPickingLawyer would have unlocked it in under a minute
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: ^for sure

Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: And yes I‚Äôm getting the mover as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you comfortable with us going to the office before you're fully vaccinated?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I can probably find a way around it if not
Yuta Baba: You mean the first two weeks or so?
Yuta Baba: Until the second vaccines in effect?
Chris Acker: I think if you wear a mask and everyone else is wearing a mask it should be fine
Yuta Baba: Yeah agreed
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: While I am not fully vaccinated
Yuta Baba: And maybe shower after u come back
Chris Acker: I mean really even after that
Chris Acker: We should be wearing masks in public for a while regardless
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: According to the cdc
Yuta Baba: True
Yuta Baba: The way I live won‚Äôt change just cuz I get vaccinated
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee

Chris Acker: Is it individuals reaching out or companies?
Yuta Baba: Companies
Yuta Baba: Could be family owned tho
Chris Acker: Oh alright
Chris Acker: What was your quote
Yuta Baba: 100-200 per hour
Yuta Baba: Some require 3 hours minimum others 2 hours
Yuta Baba: And I don‚Äôt think I need 2 hours
Yuta Baba: Just cuz my place is so close
Yuta Baba: So I guess the plan is to go there early morning and get the keys etc and have my mover help with my move on 22nd
Chris Acker: Okay
Chris Acker: I think Rounak was able to move for way cheaper than that so I‚Äôll ask him who he used
Yuta Baba: Wait what
Yuta Baba: I wanna know too
Yuta Baba: Cheaper than 100?
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs kinda insane
Chris Acker: Okay he said it was also about 100
Yuta Baba: Oh ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah makes sense
Yuta Baba: I m using a mover around that price
Chris Acker: Hmm but a U-Haul is only 20 dollars total lol
Chris Acker: Not sure if this is worth it...
Chris Acker: Maybe it is
Chris Acker: If it‚Äôs minimum 3 hours I might just get a U-Haul
Yuta Baba: There is a mover w minimum 2 hours
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm getting a shot the day before I don‚Äôt wanna move stuff by myself
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll just pay
Chris Acker sent a sticker.
Chris Acker: I'll actually probably move on the 23rd, because then I can prepare on the previous day
Chris Acker: like, get the key, and use saturday to pack my things a bit at my current place
Yuta Baba: Yeah that would be ideal but Sunday is more filled up
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to do insurance stuff tonight or shall we put that off to tomorrow?

Yuta Baba: You need to double check w them
Chris Acker: I have two people
Yuta Baba: I got 2 people, 100 bucks per hour
Yuta Baba: In total of 262 with all the service fees

Yuta Baba: But you need to double check
Yuta Baba: Yes Ik
Chris Acker: Double check how long they think it will take?

Yuta Baba: Mine took 1 hour and 45 min
Yuta Baba: But I had all the boxes in the hallway

Yuta Baba: Plus the driving
Yuta Baba: Prob 3-3.5?
Chris Acker: Yeah I have a 30 dollar truck charge

Chris Acker: What does that mean lol
Chris Acker: How did they think they had a 3 hour minimum
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs the standard for them
Chris Acker: 3 hour minimum means you pay for three hours
Yuta Baba: But I negotiated so I get 2 hour minimum
Chris Acker: Even if it took shorter
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: And I knew it wouldn‚Äôt take 3 hours so I negotiated
Chris Acker: Oh I see
Yuta Baba: And made it two hour minimum and it was done under 2 hours
Yuta Baba: Worked out perfectly
Yuta Baba: But for your case you‚Äôll go over two hours for sure
Yuta Baba: Just cuz of the additional trip you have to make from Los Altos
Yuta Baba: So you have to ask them how much per hour
Yuta Baba: If it‚Äôs 100 bucks for two ppl then 600 should be enough
Yuta Baba: I also have extra 50 if needed
Yuta Baba: But if one person 100 bucks per hour then that‚Äôs a different story
Chris Acker: Yeah it‚Äôs one person 100 bucks
Yuta Baba: Ok so 3.5 hours = $700
Truck = $30
Some miscellaneous fee = $50
Tip = $70
Yuta Baba: Are they almost done with loading your stuff?
Chris Acker: They they are done
Chris Acker: We are coming now
Yuta Baba: Oh perfect
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs not gon take 3.5 hours

Daniel Strizhevsky: What's 2x2
Chris Acker: 2 cushions by 2 fusions
Daniel Strizhevsky: I like the first kne
Chris Acker: Cushions
Daniel Strizhevsky: The light gray
Daniel Strizhevsky: So the second one-samvrutha
Chris Acker: Like the part yuta is sitting on
Chris Acker: The one in the image is a 3x2 but it comes in 2x2
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: The 3x2 would be a little too expensive and too large
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah 3*2 seems big
Daniel Strizhevsky: Does it come in a lighter color
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëé
Chris Acker: Or we can do something like this
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh interesting but then no one would sit on the side couch
Daniel Strizhevsky: We would all have to squeeze on one couch anyway
Chris Acker: Would you rather something like this
Chris Acker: Or the 2x2 style
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think 2*2 would be first choice
Daniel Strizhevsky: But I don't dislike this other style
Daniel Strizhevsky: How much is it?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can yuta sit on this for scale
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: This was samvrutha btw
Daniel Strizhevsky: Reading now
Chris Acker shared a video.
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs 120 inches
Chris Acker: So a bit large
Chris Acker: For our place
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: This one is the same but 112
Daniel Strizhevsky: Not really a fan of this
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is this comfortable?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yuta on this for size
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also yeah which is the most comfy
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah we can't fit 120
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think that's not an option
Chris Acker: They are all very comfy
Chris Acker: Mich comfier than IKEA ones
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ‚ù§
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Is this the only color or are there other options
Daniel Strizhevsky: I didn't know that was possible
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also what would be the dimensions of the 2*2 version
Daniel Strizhevsky: Remember that our 96" fake couch fit fairly snugly
Daniel Strizhevsky: I don't think we can go past 100 or so
Chris Acker: 99
Chris Acker: Would be the 2*2 version
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to take a look on living spaces website
Chris Acker: For sectionals
Chris Acker: While we are here
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: 98
Daniel Strizhevsky: Our internet is bad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is that 98 big enough for 4 to fit on?
Chris Acker: If we squeeze
Chris Acker: But the fourth could pull up a bad stool
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmmm
Chris Acker: We are always going to be limited by this 100 inch constraint right
Chris Acker: And with the 2x2 the 4th person can‚Äôt watch tv
Chris Acker: Because they are too close right
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why did the 96 feel so large then
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe the armrests were smaller
Daniel Strizhevsky: Our internet is very spotty rn so don't wait for us
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poopa
Chris Acker: Hmmm
Daniel Strizhevsky: I thought we thought that person was fine
Chris Acker: I guess we will not be getting a couch
Chris Acker: I‚Äôll be gone next weekend as well
Chris Acker: Because my friends are coming
Chris Acker: Yuta might be gone too
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why
Chris Acker: Why what
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why will we not be getting a couch
Chris Acker: Yuta and I cannot find one that markets the requirements
Chris Acker: There are no 2x2 that are light colored
Chris Acker: Light color sofas are Rare
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think this one will be that bad?
Yuta Baba: I am all for this one
Daniel Strizhevsky: If it's very comfy and you think we can fit reasonably I'm ok
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What is wrong with this one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would rather all be able to sit comfortably than have a light colored couch
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This does not look like we can all sit comfortably
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I‚Äôm down to get this one
Chris Acker: That one is not quite as comfortable as the sofas
Chris Acker: And it‚Äôs a bit more pricey
Chris Acker: At 995
Chris Acker: There were some large sofas for like 800 and very comfortable
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think color should be tertiary to comfort and proper size
Chris Acker: Also with the 2x2, it‚Äôs hard for the 4th person to watch tv, and the two in the middle‚Äôs knees will collide
Chris Acker: With the sofa, we might all be a bit squeezed at full capacity, but tv watching is good, and no knee touching
Chris Acker: And if we are that unconmfortable Someone can pull up a bar stool
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Are you guys okay with the color
Chris Acker: It does not come in another color
Daniel Strizhevsky: What size is this? Looks pretty big
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes

Chris Acker: Second one is more comfortable and has better colors
Chris Acker: But 4 people would be a bit snug
Chris Acker: The salesperson says these might sell out quickly, so we should buy soon, and he says you can get a refund up to two days before delivery
Daniel Strizhevsky: What dimensions are the big one?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can we get a yuta for size on the little one
Chris Acker: 99 x 99
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmmm yeah that one seems a bit small
Chris Acker: Okay
Chris Acker: Should we just pay the 995
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm fine with that
Chris Acker: As long as you like the color
Chris Acker: In terms of comfort the big one is a little firmer than I‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me
Daniel Strizhevsky: How comfortable is the big one compared to UPPLAND?
Daniel Strizhevsky: If it's like a lot worse than UPPLAND then maybe it's not worth, but if it's similar then it'll be the same price right? So might as well?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I prefer big
Chris Acker: Yuta thinks it‚Äôs better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Small is not big enough for us to sit
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt remember tbh
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sales man is just trying to scare us
Chris Acker: I mean if we can get a full refund why scare us lol
Chris Acker: Isn‚Äôt it valid
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is it as firm as our old couch?
Chris Acker: No
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs a nice couch
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Because he knows that most people won‚Äôt go through the hassle
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: The last one was firm cuz it was cheap
Chris Acker: This one was firm by design
Chris Acker: I mean
Yuta Baba: But it has a nice back support
Chris Acker: Every single ikea couch is sold out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I guess if it's similar to UPPLAND I'm ok with it but if it's worse then I'd probably rather wait for uppland
Chris Acker: And most of the couches here are sold out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah my coworker was saying most furniture is on like a multi-minth backorder
Daniel Strizhevsky: Month
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I agree with what Dan said
Chris Acker: Yeah they said 6 months for most of these couches
Chris Acker: And that is for the ones that are in stock
Chris Acker: They said these two were available immediately
Yuta Baba: IKEA online is not great
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôve ordered a drawer and it never came
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris do you really dislike the big boy?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: What are the dimensions
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky @Samvrutha Tumuluru u two ok with this?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you like that or walnut
Daniel Strizhevsky: I feel like walnut is better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I like the white
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The walnut in the picture looks like it will look fake
Yuta Baba: 39*23
Chris Acker: I like the idea of walnut better but I‚Äôm afraid it will look weird and cheap
Chris Acker: I think white is a safer option
Yuta Baba: Remember that the couch is on the darker side
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My same thoughts
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ah ok let‚Äôs do white for sure
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 39 * 23 will fit in front of the couch right?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan doesn‚Äôt like the white one I sent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But we both like this one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How much is the stand you already ordered?
Yuta Baba: Our TVs legs are at the end so we need a little bigger one
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs 131
Chris Acker: And 58‚Äù long
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah there is a bigger one in the link
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 60‚Äù
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Do you guys like or would prefer to stick with what we have
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm fine with yours
Chris Acker: Do you want the white one?
Chris Acker: Or the brown
Chris Acker: White?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan thinks brown will look better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I‚Äôm neutral
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think wood looks fake on the white one
Yuta Baba: The couch is on the darker side just so u know
Daniel Strizhevsky: Dark would be 60", white is 53"
Daniel Strizhevsky: Tv is 48"
Daniel Strizhevsky: We'd have slightly more space for speakers but idk if that would be too big
Daniel Strizhevsky: The dark one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Meh fine let‚Äôs just do white
Daniel Strizhevsky: Like speakers wouldn't overlap the screen which is nice
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I‚Äôm sure it will look fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Let's just do the dark one then
Daniel Strizhevsky: Unless you guys think it won't fit
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Fine let‚Äôs do dark
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah dark looks better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Tv is kinda too contrasted with the white
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think we should also just get the coffee table
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Even with the shipping fee
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It‚Äôs pretty cheap

Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: It doesn‚Äôt come with the drawers but the sizing is as good as we can give I think
Yuta Baba: *find
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I‚Äôm just afraid it will look messy without drawers
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But with all our electronics and such
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What measurement do we want again
Yuta Baba: 70*29 I think?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Isn't 13.4 too small for Chris's thing
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or almost too small I guess
Yuta Baba: I think he can live w it
Yuta Baba: The whole thing doesn‚Äôt need to be on the table
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Idk we don‚Äôt want it to be precarious
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also it will look silly if the coffee thing is hanging off
Chris Acker: It will fit on that
Chris Acker: Just about
Chris Acker: I think it‚Äôs 12.5
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: There is also this
Chris Acker: But the problem is that it‚Äôs very short

Yuta Baba: Yeah too pricy
Yuta Baba: FYI our bathroom sink is 32 inches
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yea I think my desk is 29.5
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Meh would 29.5 look silly?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it‚Äôs probably fine then I‚Äôm fine with it
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It seems most others will be out of our price range
Yuta Baba: I would be ok w it actually

Daniel Strizhevsky: I think having to enter through veterans Blvd would be a minus
Chris Acker: Hmm idk
Chris Acker: Coming north on veterans it‚Äôs certainly more convenient
Chris Acker: More convenient leaving for 101 as well
Chris Acker: Which is probably our main destination
Daniel Strizhevsky: There's more traffic though and an extra 1 or 2 lights I think
Daniel Strizhevsky: How will you go south?
Daniel Strizhevsky: You'd have to turn around when going south or coming back from north right
Daniel Strizhevsky: While around the back is fine coming from either direction
Chris Acker: Yeah but I‚Äôve never gone south before lol
Chris Acker: Have you?
Chris Acker: What is south?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh true I guess you go north to go south
Chris Acker: And I don‚Äôt think the traffic is that bad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Still coming back from 101 is worse on it
Chris Acker: Because there are a lot of lanes
Chris Acker: No it‚Äôs not
Chris Acker: Because you come back from the south
Chris Acker: That northern entrance is only an entrance
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh I come back from the north
Daniel Strizhevsky: Onto veterans
Daniel Strizhevsky: Actually even going north from veterans is technically worse cause there are 2 extra traffic lights
Chris Acker: Oh I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: bussin
Chris Acker: I mean, with the lights it‚Äôs hit or miss
Chris Acker: When the light is red, Main Street would have been faster
Chris Acker: When it is green, veterans will be faster
Daniel Strizhevsky: Tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: Idk I generally prefer using a more quiet side street

Daniel Strizhevsky: painlessly*
Yuta Baba: Does that mean the current peeler at home is safer?!?!
Daniel Strizhevsky: No I think peeler at home can do so painfully instead of painlessly
Yuta Baba: Ahhhh improvement I wanted to see
Daniel Strizhevsky: lso the blades are super sharp - while rinsing under a sink, I ran my thumb lightly over what I thought was the blunt metal edge of the peeler to make sure the sticky mango juice was not remaining but I got too close to the blade by accident and it peeled off a piece of my thumb. Thankfully, even that was so thin, I didn't even bleed and it didn't even get deep enough for me to get pain like with a papercut - it literally just sliced off a piece of my top skin without hitting any nerves. With this type of sharp, thin slicing, I might have to get another one to try it on the calluses of my feet!

Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt want to cause a skirmish here because I really don‚Äôt care that much, and it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a lot of money or anything.  But in my opinion, I think that we should all split evenly the charges that are not usage based (i.e. garbage).  For things that are usage based like water and electricity, it makes sense that only the people living in the apartment are paying.
Chris Acker: Like, if all four of us were out for a month, would no one pay?

Yuta Baba: What happened to that film
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I have not heard of this
Yuta Baba reacted with üò¢
Chris Acker: I like how your mom dressed up to go out into nature to cut down a papaya, which is opposite from the conventional logic of dressing up to feel apart from nature, and integrated with the rest of society.  Rather, your mom dressed in nature colors, specifically those of a papaya, to symbolize that she was trying to integrate into nature itself.  But then the film turns itself on its head. In trying to fit in with nature, your mom encountered physical limitations which prevented her from realizing her goals.  And it was your dad, who was in common clothing, not striving to fit in, who had the tools necessary to pluck the papaya from the tree. And in the end we are left to think: how do we select the cultures we choose to integrate with, and it is right to change ourselves for them, even if the change itself seems harmless?

Yuta Baba: We won‚Äôt be able to decide for a while tho
Yuta Baba: We will need more than 24 hours
Yuta Baba: Should we reach out to the renter to show the interest and let us know if someone is trying to book?
Chris Acker: Why will we need more than 24 hours before the booking time
Chris Acker: That‚Äôs one day before
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Misread
Yuta Baba: I thought booking time = when you book the car
Yuta Baba: And I thought it‚Äôs after not before
Yuta Baba: My bad

Yuta Baba: @Chris, when you come back from your ski trip, can you please book the PCR test somewhere a few days after you come back just in case? Which test kit did you buy? We will be actually away from Encore until next Sunday to take advantage of the long weekend. Hope you enjoy your family time and skiing!
Chris Acker: I got the only test available online, the flow flex
Chris Acker: I looked at cvs pcr tests but they are completely booked for the next few weeks
Chris Acker: Let me know if you guys can find one because we should all take one
Chris Acker: We‚Äôre you able to get those rapid tests online yuta?
Yuta Baba: I got what Dan used last time and it will arrive in a few days I think m
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll look into some test sites
Yuta Baba: Stanford has some shots from 1/24
Yuta Baba: There are some slots available in emeryville on 1/21 Friday.
Chris Acker: Oh I forgot they did testing
Chris Acker: Let me check my Stanford app
Yuta Baba: Do you think you can take one on 1/21?

Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Just sent the doc with the date on to Moises
Chris Acker: He says that you will have to get your release form signing notarized.  Are you able to do that in Japan?
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Annoying
Chris Acker: Yeah :(
Yuta Baba: I didn‚Äôt even know what notarized document mean so I ignored it
Yuta Baba: Lol
Chris Acker: Lol yeah i don‚Äôt know how it works in Japan but in the US there are notarization services
Chris Acker: They watch you sign the document, and give you another document saying that they watched you sign it
Chris Acker: To verify authenticity
Yuta Baba: There are some notarization service online
Yuta Baba: Let‚Äôs see if he can take that
Chris Acker: Oh nice
Chris Acker: üçå
Yuta Baba: When is Zach moving in
Yuta Baba: My stuff needs to be shipped before that right
Chris Acker: Hmm if it‚Äôs too annoying to notarize maybe we can keep @Yuta Baba on the lease as there is only one month left
Chris Acker: They might let us add Zach regardless
Yuta Baba: I would rather not pay $1550 so I‚Äôll get it notarized
Yuta Baba: But my worry is my stuff
Chris Acker: I mean we wouldn‚Äôt make you pay lol
Chris Acker: Zach would pay and we‚Äôd adjust your contribution to $0
Chris Acker: You would just still be financially liable for the apartment
Chris Acker: Zach was planning on moving in May
Chris Acker: (Beginning of May or end of April)
Chris Acker: He says not to worry about your stuff
Yuta Baba: I might not be able to use my benefit card as I won‚Äôt be a resident in May ü•≤

Chris Acker: It is a notification from Cigna that they are covering 70% of the cost of the covid test you got before flying back to Japan
Chris Acker: You will owe the test site you went to the remaining balance of $86.63
Chris Acker: That testing site (or doctors office) will charge you directly.  This letter is just a notice that they covered the 70 percent
Chris Acker sent a photo.

Yuta Baba: Hmmmmm
Yuta Baba: Yeah sure
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes sir you will get them
Yuta Baba: Thank uuuu
Daniel Strizhevsky: @yyta tababa we have some bad news
Daniel Strizhevsky: The boxes will probably be >$500 each
Daniel Strizhevsky: To ship
Daniel Strizhevsky: So up to you but we may need to do some research and possibly rethink what to ship/not ship
Yuta Baba: Hmmmmm
Yuta Baba: Is that USPS that you were thinking of using?
Yuta Baba: First-Class Package International Service might be the cheapest?
Yuta Baba: I don‚Äôt care how long it takes but the cheapest option would be ideal
Chris Acker: Yeah First Class International packager service by usps is the cheapest we have found.  It would probably cost about $1,500 to $2,000 to send everything
Chris Acker: Are you okay with paying that much?
Yuta Baba: Ok let‚Äôs toss a lot of things
Yuta Baba: How many boxes are you estimating
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: 2 extra large boxes
Chris Acker: Which are 21 inches x 24 inches x 20 inches
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: And one large box
Yuta Baba: Wait
Yuta Baba: Three boxes and it will cost 1500?
Chris Acker: Which is 15 inches x 16 inches x 27 inches
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs ducking insane
Chris Acker: Yeah it‚Äôs very expensive to ship to Japan
Chris Acker: And each weighs 50 - 75 pounds
Yuta Baba: If we use smaller boxes less weight would that change the price
Chris Acker: Not sure
Chris Acker: You can go to usps website and play around with the pricing calculator
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: Let‚Äôs do 3-4 boxes
Yuta Baba: Large
Yuta Baba: 15*16**27
Yuta Baba: Each 30 pounds
Yuta Baba: The rest I need to toss
Yuta Baba: Wait I can‚Äôt use priority mail international right
Yuta Baba: Can I?
Yuta Baba: In the photo
Chris Acker: Why not?
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs not for a mail right?
Yuta Baba: I can actually send a box?
Yuta Baba: Then the total cost will be 600-800, I think that‚Äôs p reasonable
Chris Acker: It says ‚Äúmax length 60 inches‚Äù under it which has to mean box
Yuta Baba: My bed & Dyson and monitor should be able to offset all the cost
Yuta Baba: Does it take 15*16*27?
Yuta Baba: Or the whole length needs to be 60 inches?
Yuta Baba: Like a fedex mail?
Chris Acker: Max length means it just has to be less than 60
Yuta Baba: Like just one side?
Yuta Baba: Then it should be ok right
Yuta Baba: Ok let‚Äôs aim for 3 boxes I‚Äôm sure I can toss a lot of my clothes
Chris Acker: Yeah that should be fine
Chris Acker: Okay but your books alone are probably more than 30
Chris Acker: Are you okay with tossing those?
Yuta Baba: Hmmm books need to go into multiple boxes
Yuta Baba: I don‚Äôt want to toss books
Chris Acker: Some things it might be cheaper to buy again though lol
Yuta Baba: I have a lot to toss anyway let‚Äôs keep books for now
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs time to kill all of my clothes tbh
Yuta Baba: I think I brought back most of the stuff I need
Yuta Baba: So I only need to pick a few clothes I need
Yuta Baba: And im gonna toss the blankies
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Yuta Baba: Except for the nicest one
Yuta Baba: Can we do another video call this weekend?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç

Chris Acker: So you can decide what goes in the box
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I sent Moises the notarized doc
Chris Acker: Thanks!
Yuta Baba: Is everything moving forward?
Chris Acker: Yeah I think we should be good to go with Zach‚Äôs move in
Yuta Baba: Awesome
Chris Acker: Maybe during the call this weekend you and Zach can also negotiate prices for anything Zach wants to buy in your room
Yuta Baba: Yeah sure
Yuta Baba: Has Zach already moved in?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No he is planning on moving in next weekend
Yuta Baba: Sounds gucci

Yuta Baba: Just curious
Yuta Baba: Is my Alexa in the boxes you guys are shipping?
Chris Acker: Yeah I think so
Yuta Baba: Perf! Thanks!
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba we tried to send the packages today but they did not let us for two reasons:
1. They were too large, so we are going to try and pack things into smaller boxes
2. We need to declare everything on a customs form (basically list everything that we are sending)
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba one more thing
Chris Acker: We were looking at Yamato TA-Q-BIN service and it might be cheaper‚Ä¶
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: https://c2c.yamatoamerica.com/Customer/CREATE
Chris Acker shared a link.
Chris Acker: The guy at USPS also recommended Yamato for sending to Japan
Chris Acker: He said it‚Äôs often cheaper through them
Yuta Baba: Oh damn thanks for doing that
Yuta Baba: Did the large box work or do you have to use a smaller box for it too?
Yuta Baba: The list sounds tricky tho‚Ä¶ and a lot of work
Chris Acker: I think the large box should be fine
Chris Acker: Just the extra large boxes might be too large
Yuta Baba: Hmmm ok I tried it
Yuta Baba: With the size of the large boxes
Yuta Baba: & 50 pounds (the maximum weight we can ship)
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs like 234 bucks so not bad might be a bit cheaper
Chris Acker: Yeah but that‚Äôs after taxes right
Chris Acker: When it did it it was like in the 190s pre tax
Yuta Baba: Yeah should be after tax
Chris Acker: Whereas I thought the price we did for USPS was pre tax?
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Yeah this is way cheaper then
Yuta Baba: Can you use ta q bin besso? I think it has some tax advantages I can use
Chris Acker: Yeah i think so, right?
Yuta Baba: Perfect!
Yuta Baba: I know it‚Äôs a lot of work to do‚Ä¶ thanks for doing everything for me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Yuta Baba can you fill out all the forms for us our Japanese isn‚Äôt so good üòÖ

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Maybe we do another call
Samvrutha Tumuluru: To itemize for customs?

Yuta Baba: Kk
Chris Acker: Everything is done online
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt think they will then pick it up from our apartment?
Chris Acker: I think*
Yuta Baba: I can make an account for myself as well
Chris Acker: Yeah then you could pay directly
Yuta Baba: And everything needs to fit under 50 pounds so I need to toss some
Chris Acker: But we will need to help you with the customs info
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: As we have all of your stuff
Chris Acker: Yeah so we will need to Redbox
Chris Acker: Re-box*
Yuta Baba: And yes you need to take either Yamato shop or ups/upss
Chris Acker: While we are re-boxing we can create the customs list

Yuta Baba: Actually I need to call Yamato on Monday
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm understanding the implications at custom
Yuta Baba: And I might have to change the name of the sender to one of you guys
Yuta Baba: They require me to submit the id info
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker can you let me know what happened to my reimbursement for COVID test?
Chris Acker: You never got the reimbursement?
Chris Acker: If you didn‚Äôt you should call your insurance company
Yuta Baba: Can you send me the letter they sent me?
Yuta Baba: I can‚Äôt use my US number and I can‚Äôt even log into the app
Yuta Baba: And don‚Äôt want to call them cuz international phone pricey
Yuta Baba: Actually jk you sent me the letter
Yuta Baba: Can you send me the transaction number or something?
Yuta Baba: The photo doesn‚Äôt have that
Yuta Baba: Only if u still keep that letter tho
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt have the letter anymore
Chris Acker: Do you see the bill on your credit card?
Chris Acker: Why would your insurance company say they paid for it if you did?
Chris Acker: That‚Äôs very abnormal
Chris Acker: Usually you don‚Äôt pay directly
Chris Acker: You just give your insurance
Yuta Baba: Yea
Chris Acker: But if you want to access your insurance account you can use a VPN right?
Yuta Baba: no I need a phone number for MFA
Yuta Baba: I do have a vpn
Yuta Baba: But need a phone
Chris Acker: Try using google voice to get a US phone number?
Chris Acker: You can use a virtual phone number with google voice
Chris Acker: When we we to Japan in 2018, we made all the reservation and did calls over a google voice number
Chris Acker: Calling is still fairly expensive tho
Yuta Baba: Yeah will look into it
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba did you call Yamato about the questions you had?
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: I learned that I cannot use besso
Yuta Baba: So I have to do another way of shipping via Yamato
Yuta Baba: So I will have to redo making the label
Chris Acker: Why not besso?  Do you think it is still better to use Yamato?

Chris Acker: Did she say 4 point fives, 4 and a half
Daniel Strizhevsky: Four point five
Chris Acker: Singular five?

Yuta Baba: Hey Chris can I use your phone number for the visa application to enter to the states?

Chris Acker: I am in Europe right now so my number probably won‚Äôt be working
Yuta Baba: That should be fine
Yuta Baba: I just need a phone number tied to the place I‚Äôm staying at
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs like the address you enter when you are flying
Yuta Baba: But I need a phone number instead
Yuta Baba: The j gov just changed the policy so I no longer need the negative covid test to enter Japan
Yuta Baba: So I might fly directly from MN to SF and then fly back home
Yuta Baba: Will let u know once I figure out my travel plan!

Yuta Baba: Cuz i don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm going to the states next time

Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba  our friend works for a bank in the US, and there are 3 businessmen coming from Japan to visit the company.  He is supposed to take them out to lunch.  Is there any etiquette that he should know about?  Like, should he buy them a welcome gift or something
Yuta Baba: Hmmmm actually I don‚Äôt know much about the business manner in jpn, but Im sure a small welcome gift would be nice (not mandatory at all)!
Yuta Baba: here is an article about it: https://www.gtalent.jp/blog/japanwork/others/japan-business-manners

Chris Acker: Ooh thx

Chris Acker: Well looks like we still owe Encore a little bit of $
Chris Acker: We owe Encore $126.32, to be exact

Yuta Baba: Excuse meeeeee
Yuta Baba: But thanks for the info

Chris Acker: Yuta obviously shouldn't pay for the utilities, but I think we can all split the cleaning fees based on the proportion of time we each spent at Encore?

Daniel Strizhevsky: @Chris Acker your math looks reasonable
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you want to put the yuta payment in splitwise? and then for encore do we just pay the normal way?
Chris Acker: Is the Splitwise already paid off?  If so maybe we just Venmo?
Daniel Strizhevsky: no it's not paid off
Daniel Strizhevsky: and i wanna put the furtniture stuff in there
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait i think this doesn't add up
Daniel Strizhevsky: this says we're only paying like 39 each total, but the thingy says we each owe 50.5?
Daniel Strizhevsky: (we being you me and samvrutha)
Chris Acker: Hmm let me check
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh it might be the parking credit
Chris Acker: Wait no that‚Äôs right
Daniel Strizhevsky: that is causing the discrepancy
Chris Acker: Yeah exactly
Chris Acker: Calculating how much we all owe was just to get the proportion
Chris Acker: Of how much we each need to pay of the outstanding debts to encore and yuta
Chris Acker: I‚Äôve invited you to the spreadsheet if you want to check
Chris Acker: Check your email
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah it looks right i'm just slightly confused about the parking credit

Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt have plans yet
Chris Acker: Hopefully not J&J
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky and @Samvrutha Tumuluru question for u
Yuta Baba: Would you add ketchup in your ham sandwich?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Neither of us eat ham sandwiches unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky: I often eat turkey sandwiches, is that similar enough
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or unrelated
Yuta Baba: Yes let‚Äôs go with turkey sandwiches
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmm
Chris Acker: Samvrutha is a vegetarian so
Daniel Strizhevsky: I've never tried with ketchup, I feel like it would be kinda weird but would be willing to try it
Chris Acker: She does not get a say unfortunately lol
Yuta Baba: Chris and I had a heated discussion on this yesterday
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: It wasn‚Äôt heated
Daniel Strizhevsky: What were the two sides
Yuta Baba: Yes it was
Chris Acker: Because I knew I was correct
Chris Acker: Ketchup does not go on cold cuts
Chris Acker: Of any kind
Chris Acker: It never has
Yuta Baba: Mainly Chris judging me for adding ketchup in sandwiches
Chris Acker: And it likely never will
Yuta Baba: And I looked up a poll on google and only 4 ppl out 54 add ketchup
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: So def minority
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I usually do mustard on mine
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'd like horseradish on it as well
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: Mustard is a must for me too
Daniel Strizhevsky: But I don't usually have horseradish on me
Yuta Baba: It was ‚Äúeither ketchup or mayo discussion‚Äù
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker Im making sandwiches rn
Yuta Baba: One will have ketchup and the other mayo
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Yuta Baba: Let‚Äôs see which one is better
Chris Acker: Kk
Yuta Baba: Ok results are in
Yuta Baba: Mayo is better
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Welcome
Chris Acker: To being a normal person üòä
Yuta Baba: Can‚Äôt believe I was eating sandwiches w ketchup on for more than a year
Chris Acker reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I have never had a ham sandwich but in general I don‚Äôt put ketchup on my sandwiches
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I do like the combo of Mayo + hot sauce
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I sometimes eat my pizza with ketchup
Chris Acker: That‚Äôs pretty weird as well
Chris Acker: But not as weird as putting it on a cold cut
Yuta Baba reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If the pizza is well sauced it isn‚Äôt necessary I feel
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But I like the cold tomato with the hot tomato taste
Yuta Baba: Ok admit I was a weirdo...
Chris Acker: Ye ye
Chris Acker: No worries
Chris Acker: As long as you understand
Chris Acker: Are you gonna live with us????
Yuta Baba: Yeah I‚Äôm excited for tmrs lunch
Chris Acker: Have you decided?
Yuta Baba: I get to eat sandwiches w mayo
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: Oh lol not yet
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm very tempted
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Daniel Strizhevsky: alright
Daniel Strizhevsky: it's time to buy some houses
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba ready?
Yuta Baba: Damn @Daniel Strizhevsky lol
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba do you know when you will be able to move in to a new apartment?
Chris Acker: Like in terms of getting off your current lease
Yuta Baba: So I think I‚Äôm having that convo with the landlord soon so will see
Yuta Baba: The thing is I don‚Äôt have a contract w them this year so I feel kike I can just leave
Yuta Baba: But maybe not I‚Äôm not sure
Yuta Baba: As I‚Äôm on a visa I don‚Äôt want to cause any issues with law
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Will late may be too early for you? Or is that possible
Yuta Baba: What do u mean
Yuta Baba: Oh late May
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs prob too early
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: Idk
Daniel Strizhevsky: i will need an apartment on may 22 :(
Yuta Baba: Can you do Airbnb?
Yuta Baba: My Neighborhood has some openings if u r interested
Yuta Baba: The same landlord and it can be very hot in summer
Yuta Baba: And far from the station
Yuta Baba: But they‚Äôll lower the price for sure
Daniel Strizhevsky: i can do airbnb in theory but then i'd need to decide like today lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause i think there are starting to be very few airbnbs
Daniel Strizhevsky: + expensive
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i'd prefer not to airbnb
Yuta Baba: Yeah makes sense
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker can you move like next month tho
Chris Acker: Yeah I just pay month-to-month so I was planning on moving out in May
Yuta Baba: Okie okie
Chris Acker: Ask your landlord!
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll need to talk w the landlord
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Ya
Yuta Baba: Do we have an estimate of the place and budget for the house?
Yuta Baba: I know we are still looking but I kinda want to get a sense of what we are aiming at
Daniel Strizhevsky: redwood city, preferably very close to caltrain
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: budget is a good q, i think 3BR apartments go for like 5-6k and homes might be more like 4-5k
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: also 3Ba if possible would add a lot of cost lol
Yuta Baba: Three bedrooms are hard to find tbh
Yuta Baba: https://www.apartments.com/radius-redwood-city-ca/vpq9t8f/
Yuta Baba shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: This looks like a good one
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's also Encore
Daniel Strizhevsky: better rated on google maps lol
Yuta Baba: Yeah that‚Äôs the best one I can find in a quick search
Yuta Baba: Yeah I‚Äôm shooting for 1.5k max hopefully so it is in my price range
Chris Acker: Oh that might me tough tho lol
Chris Acker: Idk but Dan and samvrutha would be sharing a room so they wouldn‚Äôt be paying as much
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah we can discuss price splitting
Chris Acker: I was expecting to pay more like 1700 to be honest
Yuta Baba: Oh
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think it depends how cheap the place would be
Yuta Baba: Tru tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i was thinking it would be somewhere between 25/25/25/25 and 16.6/16.6/33/33 depending on the place
Daniel Strizhevsky: what did we do last time like 19/19/32/36 or something like that?
Daniel Strizhevsky: that doesn't add up lol oops
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba are you sure you didn't mean 1.5m max with that snowflake money ;)
Daniel Strizhevsky: i assume the "k" was a typo :D
Yuta Baba: Oh gosh no I haven‚Äôt even sold one share of snowflake stocks lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky: is it still locked up
Yuta Baba: Nope
Daniel Strizhevsky: :O :O just a long-term believer?
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm not supposed to say that sorry I‚Äôm an insider lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok putting all money in snowflake now, ty
Daniel Strizhevsky: jk jk :D
Yuta Baba: I mean compared to December the price is much better to enter now
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs just the public opinion
Daniel Strizhevsky: true true
Daniel Strizhevsky: didn't @Chris Acker buy a lot at the top lol
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs on red rn
Yuta Baba: Cuz it ranked by like 45% or so lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: anyway back to housing
Yuta Baba: Wait for the lockup period to be over before buying any IPO stocks
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Ya
Daniel Strizhevsky: if we can find something in the <=5k range, i think that woudl fit your budget
Yuta Baba: That would be personally great if u guys are ok with it
Daniel Strizhevsky: is it a hard 1.5k or more like ~1.5k lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause it may be really hard to find a 3br under 5k
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm all for spending less lol but the chances are slim
Yuta Baba: Around 1.5k
Daniel Strizhevsky: also does that include utilities or just rent
Yuta Baba: But I don‚Äôt see the point of paying more than 1.7k
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Just the rent
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Yuta Baba: But including the utilities would be great as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: now if you and chris want to share a room ;) we can get it down to <1k/person :D
Yuta Baba: Sorry sorry my budget is p right now appreciate ur understanding
Yuta Baba: Oh no offense but pls no
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: no problem lol
Yuta Baba: We are not at college anymore
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok let me do a bit of digging around but
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: actually there might be a 2br with loft too i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: if you want to have a loft to save money
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol we'll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: 3Brs are unfortunately pretty expensive so we'll see whether it'll work with your budget
Daniel Strizhevsky: but we can try
Yuta Baba: Yeah thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I mean worst comes to worst I can handle it but I don‚Äôt want to set the bar high from the beginning
Daniel Strizhevsky: right
Yuta Baba: One another thing I wanted to discuss is if I can‚Äôt move in late May or early June what can we do?
Yuta Baba: Bc I don‚Äôt want my current housemates to cover the fee
Yuta Baba: Still need to have a conversation with the landlord but any ideas?
Daniel Strizhevsky: then I'd just get an airbnb, but i'm not sure if there are any available anymore lol so let me see
Daniel Strizhevsky: but in that case i'd want confirmation like today or tomorrow
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause i'd have to act fast
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My only requests are <= 0.5 miles from caltrain closer the better. And I would generally like a place that is very sunny. Seems like I may be forced to WFH 2 days a week so I need sunlight
Yuta Baba: Right makes sense
Daniel Strizhevsky: btw yuta would you consider a 2br + loft to save cost?
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's significantly cheaper?
Daniel Strizhevsky: (like what chris had last year)
Daniel Strizhevsky: that's an option here: https://www.201marshall.com/floorplans.aspx
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: (this place is also 6 weeks free and 100 feet from caltrain)
Daniel Strizhevsky: so it is likely really really cheap
Daniel Strizhevsky: also also one note
Daniel Strizhevsky: if you're trying to decide between late may or later, even outside of my own bias
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I personally like lofted apartments cause the living room is very sunny and friendly
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But you would have to be ok with having a makeshift wall
Daniel Strizhevsky: prices are going up (theyve gone up $100/month since i looked a few days ago) and i think they will continue to do so until august
Daniel Strizhevsky: so a place in july or august will probably cost a lot more
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We try to be respectful of the lofted persons bedtime though
Yuta Baba: Let‚Äôs do 3 br lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt do lofted again
Daniel Strizhevsky: what if it was like 1.1k ;)
Daniel Strizhevsky: or 1k
Chris Acker: Wouldn‚Äôt do
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Chris Acker: I make money for a reason lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: Yeah let‚Äôs not do it then
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok then to be honest
Daniel Strizhevsky: our options are like
Daniel Strizhevsky: either Encore/Radius
Daniel Strizhevsky: or hope to find something decent on craiglist
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think that's it
Daniel Strizhevsky: but @Yuta Baba and @Chris Acker would need to also confirm about sharing a bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause we won't be able to find a 3br/3ba
Samvrutha Tumuluru: ^This is true
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I wouldd prefer encore over radius
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/redwood-city/558-james-ave-redwood-city-ca-94062--2220480200

this is actually quite a good option
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/redwood-city/508-chestnut-st-redwood-city-ca-94063--1150912458

and this is an alright (but cheap) option too
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm okay with bathroom sharing
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba when do you think you'll have the talk with your landlord?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 2nd one is a little further than I would prefer
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also kitchen in second one sucks no space at all for prep
Daniel Strizhevsky: i wonder if encore has like a month off deal or something like that, they said call to ask for specials
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If they have a deal then that would be great then it meets all requirements
Yuta Baba: Ya I‚Äôd be fine sharing a bathroom
Chris Acker: Also because samvrutha would not be joining immediately we'd have to share the price of the house between the 3 of us at first
Yuta Baba: Let me tak with the landlord but not sure when he‚Äôs gon get back
Chris Acker: for one or two months depending on when samvrutha comes
Chris Acker: assuming we move in may
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs fine
Yuta Baba: Also ill be gone for like 2 months this year
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'm targeting coming back beginning of August
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll be flying back to jpn and stay w my parents for 2 months
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So you can assume I will pay august rent
Yuta Baba: But I‚Äôll pay the rent don‚Äôt worry
Yuta Baba: But just a FYI
Daniel Strizhevsky: can i come
Daniel Strizhevsky: for like 1 month maybe
Daniel Strizhevsky: :)
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôd u want to yes
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: Not sure if I can let u stay at my parents house tho
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: My mom has been a little ill
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: I hope she feels better!
Yuta Baba: And not sure if we can host u for a long period
Yuta Baba: Yeah thank u
Daniel Strizhevsky: i will stay in a love hotel
Chris Acker reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm flying back to see her
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No not allowed
Yuta Baba: But u can stay for like a week for sure!!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The love hotel not you flying to see your family of course
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: dan, you and me in a love hotel in japan
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëé
Chris Acker: let's do it
Daniel Strizhevsky: im down
Yuta Baba: Can I join too
Chris Acker: no u need to be with your mom
Chris Acker: sorry
Yuta Baba: Wow
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm offended
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll stay in a different room
Chris Acker: fine u can stay a few nights
Yuta Baba: Yayyyyyyyy
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you think this will be like days? or weeks
Yuta Baba: Hopefully days
Yuta Baba: But who knows
Daniel Strizhevsky: what's the worst case?
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôd I don‚Äôt hear back for two days I‚Äôll reach out to a different person
Daniel Strizhevsky: like if he says no, when can you move?
Yuta Baba: There are multiple options
1. Best case: I can move out anytime and no additional cost to my housemates which is highly unlikely
2. They allow me to sublet my current room
3. Worst case: contract is a contract and I have to pay until August.
Yuta Baba: Well worst comes to worst I‚Äôll pay to both my current rent and the new rent which is like a lot but I‚Äôll suck it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: nah that would suck lol let's not do that
Daniel Strizhevsky: hmm
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it was option 2, do you think you'd be able to do that by late may/early june?
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs my hope if I can find someone
Daniel Strizhevsky: or do you think that would take a while
Yuta Baba: Idk
Yuta Baba: But if I have to pay two rents for just a month that‚Äôs not the worst thing
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's for a couple weeks tbh i'd rather just pitch in for part of your rent than get an airbnb
Daniel Strizhevsky: because the airbnb I would've booked is already gone lol and i think any reasonable one would cost 2.3k+ for me
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs totally fair and I really appreciate that
Yuta Baba: Let me shoot an email to the landlord and if I don‚Äôt here back for like a couple of days I will reach out to a different person
Chris Acker: yeah i can pitch in as well in that worst case
Yuta Baba: Will keep u posted
Daniel Strizhevsky: also - what part of august? would it be aug 1 or late august
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it ends up option 3
Yuta Baba: Late August
Yuta Baba: But hey I don‚Äôt think that will happen
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah hopefully not
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok for decision making let's do this:
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 3 i think that just won't work out tbh because then samvrutha wouldn't have a place by the time she comes back and that would be too many moving parts
Chris Acker: hmm dan and i could also airbnb the room out or something for a few months...
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 1 OR option 2, i think we can work out something that starts late may and just mess around with pricing for a couple weeks if needed
Yuta Baba: Can you give me this week to sort it out?
Daniel Strizhevsky: or this yeah, but is most likely not legal, or very difficult to set up
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess just from my end, i think i'm going to commit to NOT getting a temporary airbnb
Daniel Strizhevsky: and we'll search for both 3br and 2br for now just to be safe
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then hopefully book something once you decide
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not option 2 whatever in worst case if needed I too can pitch in
Yuta Baba: Yeah sounds good to me and thank u all
Chris Acker: yeah i agree, if it's option 3 i don't think this will work and we'll have to DROP yuta
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeet
Chris Acker: let's hope for 1 or 2! lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Yeah I agree
Yuta Baba: With what Chris said
Samvrutha Tumuluru: wow that's the firstt prooper usage of yeet in a long time
Yuta Baba: Or I suck it up and pay both rents
Yuta Baba: Well see
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yuta will indeed get yeeted
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôd u give me alocohol I would be down tbh lol
Yuta Baba: Jk
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm not alcoholic just to be clear lol
Chris Acker: lol alcohol would be on me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Noted if we give him drinks we can throw him out of whatever upper story window we want
Yuta Baba: LOL
Chris Acker: i guess you could do that, but I would feel bad lol
Chris Acker: especially after you capped rent at 1500 lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also IMO if encore has 1 month off, i'm basically down to just ge tit
Daniel Strizhevsky: because that would be a reasonable price and pretty nice place
Daniel Strizhevsky: only downside is 0.5 miles from caltrain and it's on a huge road
Samvrutha Tumuluru: inappropriate. Please wash out your mouth
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true walk to train station is not ideal
Samvrutha Tumuluru: but hopefully distance means it will not be loud af during the week
Chris Acker: .5 miles = exercise = weight loss
Daniel Strizhevsky: do british websites use biscuits?
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: is that a dad joke
Daniel Strizhevsky: yes
Chris Acker: i like it, thank you
Daniel Strizhevsky: you are welcome
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true. Though I could get my weightloss from CHLOETING which only takes 10 mins of HIGH INTENSITY interval training instead
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But I see your point
Yuta Baba: Okay great news
Yuta Baba: Turned out I‚Äôm on a monthly contract so I can leave at the end of May
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm negotiating the option 1 but will see
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Ok I need to find someone to take my room
Yuta Baba: If u all know anyone or spread the words that would be much appreciated!
Yuta Baba: Will send u more information later
Yuta Baba: Bout my house
Chris Acker: Put it up on Facebook!
Chris Acker: That‚Äôs how we do it at my house
Chris Acker: Have done it many times
Yuta Baba: Yeah I have some fb groups but do u know any groups that are good
Chris Acker: I‚Äôll send you some
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I am really hoping I don‚Äôt have to cover my current rent until August
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait so first they said you can leave in end of may but then they said you need to find someone? lol
Yuta Baba: I can leave in May but I have a verbal agreement with my housemates until August
Daniel Strizhevsky: ah ok
Yuta Baba: Cuz the price for the whole house won‚Äôt change
Daniel Strizhevsky: got it
Daniel Strizhevsky: we should call Encore today btw and ask if they have any 1-month discounts or anything
Daniel Strizhevsky: i can do it after 4pm
Daniel Strizhevsky: unless anyone can earlier
Chris Acker: Please go ahead and do that Daniel
Yuta Baba: Which one is encore can u send me the link again
Chris Acker: I sent you the link in our private chat I think
Chris Acker: To the excel sheet
Chris Acker: Which has the link to encore
Yuta Baba: Ah
Yuta Baba: Smart
Yuta Baba: The spreadsheet says no availability tho
Yuta Baba: Is it available now?
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.encoreredwoodcity.com/floor-plans/
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's on available now, we'd probably have to find the next available one since it's too early
Chris Acker: Apartments in California are taken within like a week of coming on the market
Chris Acker: Sometimes faster
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: Oh ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah I‚Äôd be down for encore
Daniel Strizhevsky: actually, might be tough
Daniel Strizhevsky: it says there's one other place
Daniel Strizhevsky: and it's available 6/07
Daniel Strizhevsky: so if that means everything else that pops up will be after 6/07
Daniel Strizhevsky: taht would suck
Daniel Strizhevsky: we'll need to keep a close eye
Yuta Baba: I mean I don‚Äôt mind paying for May if necessary
Yuta Baba: If everyone like encore
Yuta Baba: Likes*
Chris Acker: Should we just pay for may to lock it in?
Yuta Baba: Ya
Chris Acker: Thoughts @Daniel Strizhevsky?
Yuta Baba: Or I can stay at my house for another month and pay a lower rent
Yuta Baba: Up to u
Daniel Strizhevsky: let's call and ask first
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: about specials + any estimates on availability
Chris Acker: Yeah definitely call first
Daniel Strizhevsky: tbh if there's stuff in early june i'd probably rather just get an airbnb for 2 weeks
Daniel Strizhevsky: but yeah let's see
Yuta Baba: Well that‚Äôs actually important cuz that‚Äôs gon decide what to write in housing groups
Yuta Baba: So let‚Äôs call today and gather information and make moves
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok
Daniel Strizhevsky: and will one of you be able to visit and see if the location is ok? that's my main worry
Daniel Strizhevsky: since it's on a large street and like 0.5 miles from downtown
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think our san mateo place was decent but closer to downtown is better, and this place is a bit further
Daniel Strizhevsky: (only a minute or two)
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'd definitely want someone to see it in person before we commit
Chris Acker: Yeah do they have open tours
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah i think so
Chris Acker: And do they operate on weekends
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll ask when i call
Yuta Baba sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah saturday 9-6 i believe
Yuta Baba: I can also go to the neighborhood and check
Yuta Baba: It will be a long walk but ok
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: üö¥
Yuta Baba: My bike has flat tires
Yuta Baba: Or just lack of air
Yuta Baba: And I don‚Äôt have a pump
Yuta Baba: We can schedule one to go too @Chris Acker
Yuta Baba: But not this weekend
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm hella busy
Yuta Baba: And prob not next Saturday it‚Äôs 5/1 and we have a reporting duty lol
Chris Acker: Okay it looks like I will be visiting lol
Yuta Baba: I mean the tour tho
Yuta Baba: I can take a walk to there
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt think we can wait that long before decking
Chris Acker: Deciding
Yuta Baba: If the tour is like 30 min I guess I can do tmr
Yuta Baba: But not 5/1
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs the end of quarter stuff...
Daniel Strizhevsky: btw we don't need to discuss the full details of pricing right now, but last time we split rent 21/21/27/31 with 4 people in the 2br+loft (and i think we split utilities 25/25/25/25?) - it would depend on how nice everyone's rooms and stuff are this time around, but are we all comfortable with something fairly similar?
Daniel Strizhevsky: e.g. if samvrutha+my room is like huge and has 2 bathrooms and closets or something we'd pay more than that, if it's like really tiny or something it woudl be less
Daniel Strizhevsky: but in that general range
Daniel Strizhevsky: and of course depends on how your two rooms cmopare
Yuta Baba: Yeah I think it makes sense
Yuta Baba: Encore is about 5k I‚Äôm all good!
Yuta Baba: Prob it‚Äôll something be like 20/20/30/30 idk but will see
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah assuming you pay like 28-29%, that would exactly meet you 1.5k budget lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: and if we get a 1 month off, that'll be really nice
Yuta Baba: Tru tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm really hoping for that 1 month off
Daniel Strizhevsky: since most places are doing it
Yuta Baba: Me too
Yuta Baba: We can negotiate maybe?
Daniel Strizhevsky: i hope so, but unlikely with these big complexes
Yuta Baba reacted with üò¢
Chris Acker: Yeah probably not unfortunately
Chris Acker: Idk, with Covid they might be more desperate but
Daniel Strizhevsky: true
Yuta Baba: We‚Äôll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: also good-ish news, you can rent up to 2 weeks in advance, so worst case we could rent for may 7th
Yuta Baba: Maybe find a close place where they have one month off and use that as a negotiation icee
Daniel Strizhevsky: not like april 23rd lol
Yuta Baba: Goooood
Daniel Strizhevsky: also one more option lol
Chris Acker reacted with üòÆ
Daniel Strizhevsky: is if we get one more friend and get adjacent 2BRs in 201 Marshall or Huxley
Chris Acker: What are the chances we can get adjacent units lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess it doesn't have to be adjacent adjacent
Daniel Strizhevsky: just nearby
Daniel Strizhevsky: just something to think about
Daniel Strizhevsky: in case we visit and see this place is way too far from downtown
Daniel Strizhevsky: or they don't have 1mo off
Daniel Strizhevsky: any questions for me to ask encore?
Daniel Strizhevsky: apart from what i'm already gonna ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: they didnt pick up i left a voicemail
Yuta Baba: When we can move in
Chris Acker: Parking fees?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Prob parking for Chris
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Yuta Baba: Yeah I was gon say that
Chris Acker: Daniel and samvrutha have a car as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Oh is that just me
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: so 2 parking spots
Daniel Strizhevsky: right?
Chris Acker: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: unless yuta you plan on carring it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll ask how much utilities usually cost too
Yuta Baba: Well since u guys have a car I won‚Äôt prob need one
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh i thought on our yosemite/tahoe trips we'd go in 4 separate cars
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba it will be hard to move to SF once you have a car because parking is no less than $400 per month in the city
Daniel Strizhevsky: for more Freedom
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker: ü¶Ö
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: Tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: tbh maybe 8 cars
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'd prefer to drive a different car there than back
Daniel Strizhevsky: downhill roads are to be enjoyed differently from uphill roads
Chris Acker: Oh wow that is excessive
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I already own 16 cars im happy to share one of 8 of my medium favorite cars with @Yuta Baba
Yuta Baba reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker: I only buy a new car when I run out of gas
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: Let me know when u run out Gad cuz I can buy ur old car and wash it very hard
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok so
Daniel Strizhevsky: no good news unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe semi-good news
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's no 1 month off
Daniel Strizhevsky: they can either give us $1000 off if we move in within 2 weeks, or they can actually give us a May 22nd move in date (but no $1k off)
Daniel Strizhevsky: parking unfortunately is tandem spot only (what we had at metropolitan with freddie), and is $150/mo
Daniel Strizhevsky: there are 10 3BRs and he doesn't know if any new ones will show up
Daniel Strizhevsky: he also mentioned that this one has been on the market for a month though lol
Chris Acker: Wtf lol
Chris Acker: Why isn‚Äôt it being taken
Chris Acker: Tandem is kind of sucky but whatever
Daniel Strizhevsky: tandem is quite bad lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you plan on driving or caltraining to work?
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause if you're driving tandem will be kind of a dealbreaker
Daniel Strizhevsky: he also said there's street parking and it's hit or miss
Chris Acker: I would be driving
Chris Acker: I wouldn‚Äôt say thats a dealbreaker tho
Chris Acker: We can plan the morning
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm sure one of us will always leave before the other
Chris Acker: Or we can just leave at the same time like good friends
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would not say deal breaker
Daniel Strizhevsky: what time do you plan on leaving work usually?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think depends on who is leaving first
Daniel Strizhevsky: leaving for work*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You just park in order
Daniel Strizhevsky: also depends who comes home first
Yuta Baba: Wait dan r u driving to work
Yuta Baba: Thought ur taking cal train
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm not 100% sure yet
Daniel Strizhevsky: the tandem spot it also a stack
Daniel Strizhevsky: so someone would have to leave first and come back last
Daniel Strizhevsky: and the other leave last and come back first
Chris Acker: What if we have each other an extra key and we can always move the other persons car lol
Chris Acker: Give*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would say the parking spot being a deal breaker is a bit much
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If we had a lot more options then sure
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs kinda annoying
Daniel Strizhevsky: fine i'll say not dealbreaker but it's a major inconvenience i'd say
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But due to all our restrictions it‚Äôs the smallest concession
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm not gon saying on this as I don‚Äôt have a car
Daniel Strizhevsky: if we have to switch every single day
Yuta Baba: And sounds like I shouldn‚Äôt buy a car for this year
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: So u guys get to take me anywhere that would be fun
Daniel Strizhevsky: i wouldn't underestimate how annoying it is to switch cars 1-2x a day
Daniel Strizhevsky: 1x is all but guaranteed
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i won't say dealbreaker but i think it's quite inconvenient lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also for comparison metropolitan was $80 for tandem spot
Daniel Strizhevsky: this would be the only option i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: but yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They said there is street parking as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Though it is ‚Äúhit or miss‚Äù
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh yeah also we're responsible for all utilities - they estimated $175/mo for water + sewage + trash
Chris Acker: Maybe the situation will be elucidated a bit more when I go in person
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then the rest is electricity
Chris Acker: That‚Äôs reasonable
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: also
Daniel Strizhevsky: they said CURRENTLY no spots available but there's a waitlist
Daniel Strizhevsky: let me forward this email
Chris Acker: I will let you
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Babawhat's your email?
Chris Acker: bana.yuta@gmail.com
Chris Acker: Baba*
Daniel Strizhevsky: classic bana
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Chris Acker when you go check it out can you scope out the street parking situation and see if the street is actually completely full or if it seems like a good option
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Let me know when u r going I might be able to tag along
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: also
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see 2 options for encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think I‚Äôm getting high ogg the fumes lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: a) just book for may 22
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Wrong chat
Daniel Strizhevsky: sorry
Daniel Strizhevsky: was dealing with some fumes
Daniel Strizhevsky: b)
Daniel Strizhevsky: risk it and wait a week or two before booking
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then we get both the $1000 and a late may move in date
Daniel Strizhevsky: because it says look&lease is only valid for 24 hrs after tour
Yuta Baba: Can you check how big the closet is
Yuta Baba: I need to think if I need to bring y drawer
Yuta Baba: Which would be pain
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Oh yeah do they say room square ft anywhere
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I didn‚Äôt se it on website
Chris Acker: I think this is the least of our worries lol
Yuta Baba: 1436ft
Daniel Strizhevsky: 14XX sq ft
Daniel Strizhevsky: which worry
Yuta Baba: And I have no idea how big that is
Chris Acker: Closet space
Daniel Strizhevsky: i feel like a lesser worry is the color of the fridge
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i get what you're getting at
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If the fridge is white I‚Äôm out
Yuta Baba: Tru tru just listing up all the questions I have
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be living on my own
Samvrutha Tumuluru: In a different city
Chris Acker: In a dumpster
Yuta Baba: We can paint it
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: this is the Engineering Mindset
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it isn‚Äôt stainless steel then I will throw it out
Yuta Baba: Oh u can take the parking spot
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And set the apartment on fire
Yuta Baba: Yo i work in the tech industry lol
Yuta Baba: I do everything to make it work ok
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: You can build ur own fridge in ur room
Yuta Baba: Can‚Äôt change the material sorry
Chris Acker: You can turn the fridge into extra closet space
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok so
Daniel Strizhevsky: let's make a yung decision
Yuta Baba: And keep it clean and fresh
Yuta Baba: And little chilly
Yuta Baba: Great for summer
Daniel Strizhevsky: do we risk it or tour tomorrow?
Daniel Strizhevsky: we need to respond to Yung Man
Chris Acker: Is it a risk
Yuta Baba: Did u ask how many ppl are interested
Yuta Baba: Or just us
Daniel Strizhevsky: no i didn't ask
Yuta Baba: Damniiiit
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk if they'd answer that honestly lol
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs ok not ur fault
Yuta Baba: Tru
Chris Acker: Even if I tour tomorrow, would they be able to connect that to an application later that you submit?
Chris Acker: I guess it would have my name on it but, I wonder how hard they are tracking
Daniel Strizhevsky: well
Daniel Strizhevsky: the risk is also about other people taking it
Daniel Strizhevsky: not just the 24 hour thing
Yuta Baba: Which can happen
Chris Acker: Yeah but I mean we can tour tomorrow anyway
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: Ok I actually will tag along if I feel ok tmr
Daniel Strizhevsky: he told me to respond to his email to schedule the thing
Yuta Baba: I just got vaccinated
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe you can just respond to schedule
Chris Acker: Okay

Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: walk-in closet

Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Yuta Baba: Not bad
Yuta Baba: Looks a bit far from the station tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah it's 0.1 miles further, but it doesn't have a large street to cross
Daniel Strizhevsky: so it may even out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Kitchen bad, distance far, and only 1000 sqft which is small for 4 people
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Indigo apartments are nice but too expensive üò≠üò≠
Chris Acker: How much is indigo again
Daniel Strizhevsky: 6.8k + 1 month off lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: so still like 6.2k
Daniel Strizhevsky: we can call and ask if it's negotiable cause nobody is gonna rent a 6.8k 3br lol
Chris Acker: Holy freakin moly
Chris Acker: If you guys pay 1450, Yuta pays 1500 and I pay 1800 then it could work lol
Yuta Baba: Why would I only pay 1500 that‚Äôs not fair
Yuta Baba: I mean I would be happy about it but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol indigo is probably not worth if it‚Äôs that expensive
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have mixed reviews on Google
Chris Acker: Wait so if they are not doing in person tours would I just be going over there to look at the outside?
Chris Acker: Of we are doing a virtual tour can‚Äôt we all do it together?
Chris Acker: If*
Yuta Baba: If virtual yes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They aren‚Äôt doing in person!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: *?
Yuta Baba: Rona
Yuta Baba: Makes sense
Chris Acker: Oh in the email it says you can do a set guided tour
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: Let me look on their website if I need to set that up or I can just go..
Chris Acker: Well I think I should just be able to go..
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba do you want to go check it out today?
Yuta Baba: Yeah I can spare an hour or two
Chris Acker: Okay I‚Äôve got to shower and stuff but I can probably pick you up in an hour or so
Yuta Baba: Do we need to reserve the tour
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt think so?

Yuta Baba: Can u check before we go
Chris Acker: I‚Äôll call them
Yuta Baba: Okie thx thx
Chris Acker: They are not picking up the phone
Yuta Baba: Yikes
Yuta Baba: We can just go and knock

Chris Acker: We can get a resident to show us their apartment
Chris Acker: Or we can break in
Yuta Baba reacted with ‚ù§
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ‚ù§

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yes pls! And check that all the sinks and such flush and turn on etc
Chris Acker: Uh oh, the sinks didn‚Äôt flush

Daniel Strizhevsky: How was it
Yuta Baba: we liked it
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: chris is gon send u the videos we took
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: each room is a bit small but not too small and i think we can make it work
Yuta Baba: not sure about where you would work tho the master bed room cannot handle one bed and two deks
Yuta Baba: desks
Yuta Baba: so one of u has to work in the living room which is p spacious
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'll probably be in the office all the time so it's probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: How do the rooms compare to metropolitan
Daniel Strizhevsky: And how's the lighting!?!
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess I'll wait to see the video lol
Yuta Baba: not sure about the individual room but the living room in san mateo is def bigger
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Yuta Baba: but encore is p spacious for four of us too
Yuta Baba: we have a lot of windows no no light needed during the day
Yuta Baba: the entrance light is yellowish but we didnt try the other lighting sadly
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee I meant natural lighting, that's good
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh interesting lol I thought that place was 1200sf
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe not
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: The ones outside is the roof top
Yuta Baba: We have the common room and rooftop and garden with the grill for the residents
Yuta Baba: Plus the gym
Daniel Strizhevsky: I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks pretty good, maybe not quite the metropolitan lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: And oof 10x10 is a small master lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you sure it wouldn't fit 2 desks?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess depends on layout
Yuta Baba: Depends on the desk size and how u want to lay out the room yes
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I forgot even if I don't wfh I still need a desk
Daniel Strizhevsky: To GAME and study and such lol
Chris Acker: I sent a video of it to samvrutha
Chris Acker: Messenger wouldn‚Äôt let me send it because the file is too large...
Yuta Baba: Lol
Chris Acker: And I couldn‚Äôt send it to Dan because he is android (bleh)
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: But I think it went through to Samvrutha
Chris Acker shared a video.
Chris Acker: Here are some shorter videos to tide you over
Chris Acker shared a video.
Yuta Baba: @Chris Ackerwhats the housing group you used before?
Yuta Baba: trying to post it
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Not sure if Redwood City counts as ‚Äúsouth bay‚Äù..
Chris Acker: But the Bay Area one would work for you
Yuta Baba: Ya
Yuta Baba: Thx
Chris Acker: There is also a group called Redwood City Shop and trade so you might want to put it there too
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you guys think that island would fit 4 people on one side?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Like our previous bar
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or will we need a separate table
Chris Acker: I think it will fit 4 people
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks to me like a slightly worse metropolitan overall, is that the vibe you guys got
Chris Acker: No I felt like it was a slightly better metropolitan
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÆ
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: The building was built in 2019
Chris Acker: So everything felt very new and in good order
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I guess the finish is nicer, but everything is quite a bit smaller isn't it
Chris Acker: At metropolitan everything felt like it was falling apart lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad that the rooms are so small I think bedroom size is the main downside
Chris Acker: I think the bedrooms other than master are a comparable size
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess our bedroom last time was quite small too
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think this master is smaller?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like idk who designed the buildings but by making the closets slightly smaller and removing that book they could have gotten a lot of space
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba what are the master bedroom dimensions again?
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs on that sheet
Chris Acker: I could also find it online I guess
Daniel Strizhevsky: He sent a pic
Chris Acker: It actually doesn‚Äôt say on the website lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's like 10.5*10.5
Chris Acker: Oh o see
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think metropolitan was 10.5*12.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Rip
Daniel Strizhevsky: I mean it's probably doable
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why is the master smaller though lol is that common
Daniel Strizhevsky: That seems weird
Chris Acker: You lose 2 ft on one side
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmm
Yuta Baba: one alternative is dan and samvrutha takes one of the non master and use the bathroom for the non master
Yuta Baba: and chris and i will use the master bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Resending right side up
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Chris Acker: Yeah it‚Äôs just a bit awkward that one would have to go into the other persons room lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: You have to go into the master br to use it right
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah only problem with that is like you have to go through the persons room
Yuta Baba: mY bAd
Yuta Baba: it depends on when they take a shower
Yuta Baba: i dont know just throwing out an idea
Daniel Strizhevsky: Where it says "linen" on the floorplan that's just the nook right?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Another idea is one desk in master
Daniel Strizhevsky: No closet?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And one desk in that random nook
Chris Acker: Yes
Yuta Baba: there is a bigger closet in the master
Daniel Strizhevsky: I can't see how this place is more sq ft than metropolitan lol
Yuta Baba: did metropolitan consider the rooftop to be part of that sq feet
Chris Acker: Metropolitan also didn‚Äôt have any hallway
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: i feel like it might not
Yuta Baba: yeah hall way is quite long actually
Yuta Baba: unnecessarily
Yuta Baba: and that nook for no reason
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think balconies usually aren't counted
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe the balcony here is?
Yuta Baba: idk
Chris Acker: I mean square footage is not an issue besides the master bedroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think living room has enough space?
Yuta Baba: i second taht
Daniel Strizhevsky: For like couch + tv
Chris Acker: Yes
Daniel Strizhevsky: And a table?
Daniel Strizhevsky: And stuff
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok cool
Yuta Baba: the living room is spatious
Chris Acker: I think we could even get a desk in the living room perhaps
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: So you could maybe fit one in the master bedroom and another out there
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think yeah living room space is probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok so how about non interior stuff
Daniel Strizhevsky: Thoughts on location? How's the big road
Yuta Baba: there is a storage
Yuta Baba: all shared
Yuta Baba: and each closet is huge
Yuta Baba: you can even put your desk in the storage
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: You can hear traffic from the apartment but not worse than metropolitan I think
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: no natual lighting tho but it is huge
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: Location is pretty good.  It might get a bit annoying crossing the big road, but J walking might be a possibility as well :)
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: and it has some nice view that redwood has to offer
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòã
Chris Acker: Yeah the view is pretty good for Redwood City
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Is this our only option what was the other apartment complex?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Overall has the tour made you strongly pro encore
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt think we have another
Yuta Baba: yeah this room is a corner room closest to the big street
Yuta Baba: yeah i think we liked encore
Chris Acker: Besides the expensive one
Yuta Baba: but i think the issue comes down to the master bedroom
Chris Acker: We have some houses that we could consider
Yuta Baba: prob worth mentioning that we have 1000 bucks coupon that that expires today right?
Yuta Baba: so if we want to move in we should prob decide today
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think the other place was radius
Yuta Baba: radius is p close from encore actually
Yuta Baba: we have two 3BD and 2 Bathrooms there
Yuta Baba: i mean chris we can try tomorrow if we want to check it out
Yuta Baba: the sq feet is smaller at radius tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: Btw
Daniel Strizhevsky: If we're willing to pay 5260
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I wish they would put dimensions on these floor plans
Daniel Strizhevsky: We should consider this too, 3 baths even
Chris Acker: They are probably closed on Sunday right

Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sqr fr could be smaller but if it is better allocated might not matter
Daniel Strizhevsky: And the house is likely negotiable
Yuta Baba: no sunday is open

Yuta Baba shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you guys still in rwc?
Chris Acker: Nope
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: that house looks nice but is a bit pricyyy
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah but since it's a house we can negotiate
Daniel Strizhevsky: So we can probably make it <= encore price
Chris Acker: Hmm I don‚Äôt know about that
Chris Acker: Also it doesn‚Äôt look like that house has A/C
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: It says ‚Äúcooling features: none‚Äù
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: It was built in 1922 lol
Chris Acker: I‚Äôm kind of scared of houses because they are old and things break and it‚Äôs a pain
Chris Acker: Never underestimate the value of new things
Chris Acker: The internet connection might also be questionable
Yuta Baba: I feel like we should visit radius tmr?
Yuta Baba: it doesnt say the price but we can call before we go
Yuta Baba: and we can book an appointment online
Chris Acker: Sure
Chris Acker: Do you know if we have to set up a meeting
Chris Acker: Can you book an appointment for tomorrow morning?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Fair enough
Daniel Strizhevsky: It might not have availability, yeah you should ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: Also irrelevant but
Yuta Baba: Yeah we can book online
Daniel Strizhevsky: Metropolitan 3Br is 4.8k and 2 months off ü§¶
Yuta Baba: I mean o would be down for metropolitan tbh
Chris Acker: I would not lol
Chris Acker: Too far
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Daniel Strizhevsky: Same but it's far for Chris and samvrutha lol
Chris Acker: From work
Yuta Baba: Fair
Yuta Baba: Yeah redwood apartments don‚Äôt have 3 bedrooms
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think we should check out radius if the building seems poorly maintained or something then yeah lets just go with encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan and I will be able to figure out something with the desks
Yuta Baba reacted with ‚ù§
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker r u down to go tmr
Samvrutha Tumuluru: As long as you bois don't mind the possibility of one of our desks maybe needing to go in the living room maybe
Yuta Baba: If you are ok w that table being the table for beer pong yes :)
Yuta Baba: Or like Chris said you can set the desk in some space in the hallway

Yuta Baba: So we gotta be a bit quick
Yuta Baba: Idk
Yuta Baba: Do u wanna pick me up at 1040 tmr morning
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The recent reviews for radius are kinda scary
Samvrutha Tumuluru: mainly lots of packages being stolen
Samvrutha Tumuluru: one person said there were homeless people sleeping in the stairwell?
Yuta Baba: What the hell
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Can you pls check the mailroom/ stairwell if possible during your visit
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: We can also ask about the security as well
Yuta Baba: Encore is p safe cuz you can‚Äôt use the elevator if u don‚Äôt have the key
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is the second review I've seen talking about homeless people in the stairwell
Samvrutha Tumuluru: my hopes for radius are low
Yuta Baba: Would u be ok living in encore?
Yuta Baba: I mean we can still check out radius
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs 8 months ago it might be different now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: there was one from 1 month ago as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it isn't a huge inconvenience I think we should still check it out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But like almost every review mentions packages being stolen
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And mail being left out in the lobby
Samvrutha Tumuluru: like letters from the dmv irs etc
Yuta Baba: Hmmmm not good
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And the property management being bad and unresponsive
Yuta Baba: I mean if that‚Äôs the constant review and we might want to pass it
Yuta Baba: We can still check it out tho
Yuta Baba: If Chris is down
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs basically him driving so lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Let me see what Dan thinks
Samvrutha Tumuluru: but after seeing this picture
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Might be a hard pass for me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: for radius
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôm on the same boat as u @Samvrutha
Chris Acker: I don't mind coming to check it out
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: Ok let‚Äôs do that and we decide tmr
Chris Acker: I texted their number and asked if there was any availability
Chris Acker: and then they sent me a welcome email
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÆ
Chris Acker: how did they get my email???
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: Lol
Yuta Baba: Creepy
Yuta Baba: @Samvrutha I would that it would happen at Encore, it has a releasing office in the first floor so if something happens they would notice
Yuta Baba: *i dont think it would happen at Encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: lol tbh I'm not sure how radius has maintained such a high rating on google with the number of 1 stars üòÇüòÇ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have gotten hardly any good reviews in the last like 2 years
Yuta Baba: Lol
Yuta Baba: I mean it looks from outside
Yuta Baba: But mailboxes are cray cray
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok cool I guess we will see how it is tomorrow. If it seems sketch then I've made my peace with the room size at encore
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: What about Dan's house?
Chris Acker: If we check and it has air conditioning are we still interested?
Chris Acker: Should we reach out to them?
Yuta Baba: If we can negotiate the price
Yuta Baba: Idk
Chris Acker: Okay so encore is your hard limit price wise?
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs funny that we don‚Äôt like radius and it might be more expensive lol
Yuta Baba: I mean that would be great
Chris Acker: I can‚Äôt imagine the list of things that could go well for radius for us to change our mind about this
Yuta Baba: Dans house is like 3br 3 bathroom so I would say even split that would be like 1.8k
Yuta Baba: It‚Äôs a bit pricy
Chris Acker: What do you mean by even split?
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs 5550/month and there are 4 of us
Yuta Baba: 3 bedroom 3 bathrooms so dan/Samvrutha pays 1/3 you pay 1/3 and I pay 1/3 no?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think the house is only an option if they are willing to negotiate the price and it has air conditioning
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: No Dan and Samvrutha would pay more because a house is more than its bedrooms
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: maybe we just reach out to them and see if they are flexible?
Yuta Baba reacted with üëç
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker 1040 tmr?
Chris Acker reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How's it looking
Chris Acker: It‚Äôs not available lol
Chris Acker: The unit
Chris Acker: So we are not going
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Chris Acker: The person from the house got back to me tho and said they‚Äôd be willing to do 5300
Chris Acker: But they did not answer my question as to whether or not there was air conditioning
Chris Acker: The person I was in contact with told me to ‚Äúcall their husband about that‚Äù lol
Chris Acker: I called but no one picked up
Chris Acker: Left a message

Yuta Baba: So no one in the office today?
Yuta Baba: Maybe we have to wait for another day lol
Chris Acker: We can apply online, but it doesn‚Äôt let me select a start date past the 10th
Yuta Baba: Hmm
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt know.  It said the number was out of service
Yuta Baba: That‚Äôs weird
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevskywhat number did you call?
Chris Acker: Did you just call louiegi directly?
Yuta Baba: Louiieeeegi where u at
Chris Acker: We could submit an application online, but the start date would have to be the 10th
Chris Acker: Maybe we could ask them to change that later? Not sure
Yuta Baba: Can we leave a comment in the application?
Yuta Baba: Saying we prefer a later start date
Chris Acker: I don‚Äôt think so
Yuta Baba: Hmmmmmm
Yuta Baba: You tried these right

Call 833-761-3073
Email encore@sares-regis.com
Chris Acker: Wait I typed in the number wrong lol
Chris Acker: One sec
Chris Acker: Okay now I‚Äôm getting through to the number but it‚Äôs stuck in a loop lol
Chris Acker: Call the number and you will se what I mean
Daniel Strizhevsky: I called +16504740400 I think
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jk
Daniel Strizhevsky: That's what they called me back from
Daniel Strizhevsky: I called 8337613073
Chris Acker: Yeah that‚Äôs what I tried
Chris Acker: It just says ‚Äúpress one to continue‚Äù on loop
Chris Acker: (Yes, I pressed it)
Yuta Baba: What the fuck
Yuta Baba: This is infinite loop
Yuta Baba: Someone fix this annoying bug
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The number dan sent just goes to voicemail
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But no infinite loop
Yuta Baba: The one starting with 833
Yuta Baba: That goes to the loop
Yuta Baba: Let‚Äôs try pressing 2
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sorry the first number he sent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It goes to luigies voicemail
Yuta Baba: That might break the while loop
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Just kidding second number is not an infinite loop eaither
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I pressed 1 and then it took me to the same voicemail
Chris Acker: It should definitely not take you to louiegi‚Äôs voicemail because that is the encore number
Chris Acker: Did you get the voice saying that a service agent would be with you shortly
Yuta Baba: Actually I pressed few other buttons and then 1 and the phone started behaving like a norma phone does but not one picked it up
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I guess I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs Luigi
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It was just a dude saying blah blah encore leave message will call back
Yuta Baba: Luigi we are marios answer ur phone plz
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But he had an accent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I guess unfair to assume
Yuta Baba: But is it just him working at a leasing office?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I mean it never says this is Luigi
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or anything
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Louie go
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I mean doesn‚Äôt matter it goes to voicemail was my point lol
Yuta Baba: He‚Äôll get back to us tmr
Chris Acker: Hmm weird
Chris Acker: I never got to that point
Chris Acker: You are saying that the two phone numbers lead to the same answering machine?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Try the 165 number
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It skips the automated lady
Chris Acker: I did
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Oh weird
Chris Acker: Yeah I agree with that one
Chris Acker: The 165 goes to an answering machine
Yuta Baba: Maybe u r blocked Chris
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: The 833 leads to a press one loop
Daniel Strizhevsky: hey well if we can't reach them other people probably can't lol
Chris Acker: No one would ever block me trust me
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: They know the consequences
Daniel Strizhevsky: as long as The Competition is Dead

Daniel Strizhevsky: btw would you guys consider Purchasing a house?
Daniel Strizhevsky: instead of renting
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Negatives
Daniel Strizhevsky: shut it
Chris Acker reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Shut it
Daniel Strizhevsky: could be more economical to Purchase a house
Yuta Baba: If i know for sure I stay in CA for a longer time I could
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Negatives p
Chris Acker: R u serious?
Chris Acker: Cant tell
Daniel Strizhevsky: i am serious
Daniel Strizhevsky: i mean
Daniel Strizhevsky: i don't htink i will stay in CA for particularly long
Daniel Strizhevsky: but we can just sell after 1-1.5 years
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Nuggative
Chris Acker: How would it work with 4 of us on the thingy
Yuta Baba: My friend who‚Äôs moving to MN for phd is buying a house
Chris Acker: How much would the down payment be
Yuta Baba: Not a lot
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Chicken nugget
Yuta Baba: But selling after a year is not good
Chris Acker: Why
Yuta Baba: Why would u buy a house in the first place
Yuta Baba: For just one year
Chris Acker: Because then you don‚Äôt lose money
Chris Acker: Theoretically
Chris Acker: If you rent you just lose the money
Daniel Strizhevsky: because your monthly cost is almost the same as renting yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you get equity for it
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you can capture real estate price increases on top of that
Daniel Strizhevsky: although it's higher risk
Daniel Strizhevsky: like
Chris Acker: You only lose money if the price goes down
Chris Acker: With renting you are throwing away 20k per year
Yuta Baba: Which is highly unlikely
Daniel Strizhevsky: we're making a $63k investment already here
Yuta Baba: I don‚Äôt know the tax implications of buying a house
Chris Acker: There would be taxes
Chris Acker: And some interest rate set by the bank
Yuta Baba: I HATE TAXES
Chris Acker: And perhaps property repair expenses
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah Texas is the worst state IMO
Chris Acker: So it‚Äôs not like an all around better choice
Yuta Baba: Where did Texas come from lmao
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ‚ù§
Chris Acker reacted with ‚ù§
Daniel Strizhevsky: we can do some math i guess
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + closing costs + inspection costs
Daniel Strizhevsky: and interest rates are like under 3% right now i think
Chris Acker: Yuta won the math award at my high school
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + time and effort of buying and selling a house
Chris Acker: He‚Äôs got us
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + the cost of paying 2 rents if we move and then can‚Äôt sell the house in time
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok yuta go math it out
Yuta Baba: That was four years ago
Chris Acker: Did you get dummer?
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: And I‚Äôm not calculating taxes
Yuta Baba: Cuz I don‚Äôt know the rules
Yuta Baba: I only know taxes in investment
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think you get some tax incentives if you own a house though
Chris Acker: Nah you pay property taxes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: That is what I noticed while doing my taxes a couple weeks avo
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah but they give you some credits back
Chris Acker: In California they even make you pay a few hundred dollar towards education to support the local schools
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Kinda like electric car incentives
Yuta Baba: I mean do we want to just wait for another day our luigi is gon get back to us
Yuta Baba: If we want to buy a house we need to find a place first
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I don‚Äôt think this is the time to buy a house IMO
Chris Acker: I feel like you can get tax incentives to lower your property taxes but i didn‚Äôt think they would be a net positive
Yuta Baba: If we sell it a few years later it will for sure
Yuta Baba: Appreciation
Chris Acker: Yeah if we only own it for a year I‚Äôm not sure that the complexity is worth it
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üëç
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not net positive just something to factor in
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If we are doing some calculations
Yuta Baba: I would want to study taxes but not the right timing cuz it‚Äôs the end of fiscal quarter
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: And agreed not sure if it‚Äôs worth it given all the complexities
Daniel Strizhevsky: fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: house DEAD
Chris Acker reacted with ü•≥

Daniel Strizhevsky: but i didn't get to see the living room
Daniel Strizhevsky: or would we need to lamp it up
Yuta Baba: Looking at the photos we might need to lamp it up
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Yuta Baba: Might not have a lot of lightings in bedrooms either
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah no lights in bedrooms i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: that's another positive of the house i guess

Daniel Strizhevsky: plug in

Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üò¢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ‚ù§

Yuta Baba: Doesn‚Äôt give u a lot of lights but it‚Äôs cool
Daniel Strizhevsky: it kept falling down in my+samvrutha's room last time lol
Yuta Baba: My room is famous for empty decorations

Yuta Baba: Yikes
Yuta Baba: Maybe not then lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: eh they were probably cheap
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Something like this for living room would be nice I think
Yuta Baba: Oh ya for sure
Yuta Baba: I have the lamp I bought for a bike
Yuta Baba: We don‚Äôt want to directly flush it at us but I could direct it to the ceiling it might be good
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with üòÜ
Yuta Baba: Or maybe something for my room lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah we'll find something lol
Yuta Baba: Also flash not flush
Yuta Baba: Gooooosh
Daniel Strizhevsky: also we've learned from last time that you can pretty easily get 80-100% value back by selling furniture and stuff at the end of the lease
Yuta Baba reacted with ‚ù§
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i'm pretty open to getting nice things
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan caused string lights to fail
Samvrutha Tumuluru: By insisting we put them too tightly on the wall
Daniel Strizhevsky: i didn't cause them to short though lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And then they would fall off
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I bought really cheap lights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be using string lights in our room
Yuta Baba: I might consider that as well we‚Äôll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll just give you samvrutha's string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: when i take them off
Daniel Strizhevsky: no need to buy any yourself :)
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This will not be the case
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will super glue them to the wall
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Then I will super glue Dan to the opposite wall
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll cut the wall out
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So he must stare at the lights all day
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You won‚Äôt do that because I‚Äôve already taken care of super glueing you to the wall
Yuta Baba: I‚Äôll glue u to the samvrutha u guys can stare at each other all day long
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with üòÜ
Samvrutha Tumuluru: As long as I have my string lights
Yuta Baba reacted with üòÜ
Chris Acker: I thought the bedrooms had ceiling lights
Chris Acker: I remember seeing tiny bulbs
