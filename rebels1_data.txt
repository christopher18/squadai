Chris Acker: And why they believe what they believe
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol I love flat earth stuff
Chris Acker: Yeah I’d say it definitely painted a new perspective of them for me
Chris Acker: I think it basically warns scientists that we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss other people opinions because the result is flat Werthers
Chris Acker: Earthers*
Chris Acker: But I don’t want to ruin it for you
Chris Acker: It’s great because the flat earthers set up an experiment to prove the earth was flat.  But it actually proved the earth was round LOL
Chris Acker: A very effective experiment with an unintended outcome for them

Yuta Baba: That’s my observation with a sample 1
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk everyone knows when the lockup expires
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i feel like it's mostly priced in
Yuta Baba: Exactly I mean for snowflake the first lockup expired on 12/15 so the price went up up up and reached the peak a week before and tanked
Yuta Baba: So by the time employees got to seek some stocks it was already way lower than the peak
Daniel Strizhevsky: when @Chris Acker bought in :)
Yuta Baba reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: LOL

Chris Acker: How could you be talking to him if it wasn’t your phone lol
Chris Acker: That doesn’t make sense to me
Yuta Baba: He called me
Yuta Baba: And he texted me the code
Yuta Baba: I told him the code verbally
Chris Acker: What does that prove?
Yuta Baba: That I own my phone number
Chris Acker: He is literally on a call with you on that phone number
Yuta Baba: Ya tru
Yuta Baba: Lol
Yuta Baba: Ya trying to incorporate the new technology and failing to do the job it’s supposed to do
Chris Acker: Even if it’s not your phone, if you can answer a call on it you can also read a text lol
Chris Acker: That’s hilarious lolol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Unless this is a scam
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: And he's logging into our bank accounts

Yuta Baba: Do I need to do anything
Yuta Baba: Sorry I haven’t read any emails etc
Chris Acker: Just sign the lease I think
Chris Acker: Just log in to the encore portal as a resident
Chris Acker: And follow the instructions
Yuta Baba: Oh okay there’s actually a stuff to do then
Yuta Baba: Ugh
Yuta Baba: Okay let me do that tonight
Chris Acker: Takes 5 min lol
Yuta Baba: Gooooood luuuuck
Yuta Baba: Hawaii’s beach is waiting for ya
Daniel Strizhevsky: heehoo
Daniel Strizhevsky: BAD do not sign without reading
Daniel Strizhevsky: we almost LOST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS last time
Daniel Strizhevsky: due to tricksters
Daniel Strizhevsky: trying to trick
Daniel Strizhevsky: did you not learn your lesson @Chris Acker??
Yuta Baba: Wait what happened
Yuta Baba: Also what is this renters insurance thingy
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I can't sign the thing
Samvrutha Tumuluru: they texted me a code
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I put in the code
Samvrutha Tumuluru: it didn't work
Samvrutha Tumuluru: there is no way to get another code sent
Yuta Baba: Did u mistype it
Samvrutha Tumuluru: no i tried putting it in 3 times
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Mine worked actually
Yuta Baba: Maybe click the link from the email once again or complain to Mario?
Yuta Baba: Also Chris 29 pages wtf
Yuta Baba: Ok you can’t smoke weed in the facility
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: You can end the contract early but you have to pay about 10k to do it
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I’m confused about electricity?
Chris Acker: @Samvrutha Tumuluru can you just try signing in by going to encore's website and going to the resident portal?
Chris Acker: I didn't use any code...
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba we have to set up an electricity account with PG&E, which is a company that supplies most of california's electricity.  We will pay them for electricity directly rather than going through Encore
Chris Acker: And we also need to buy renters insurance
Chris Acker: Which is insurance that takes effect in case we destroy anything, or things are damaged in case of flooding or fire, etc
Chris Acker: Pretty much all apartments require that you have insurance
Yuta Baba: Did u buy this to live in metropolitan
Chris Acker: yes, and all the previous apartments i have lived in
Yuta Baba: Oh okay
Yuta Baba: Any recs on the company?
Chris Acker: Who did we do it through before @Daniel Strizhevsky@Samvrutha Tumuluru?
Chris Acker: Lemonade or something?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: yeah lemonade
Samvrutha Tumuluru: oh nvm
Samvrutha Tumuluru: it was their included insurance
Yuta Baba: I’ll do some research this weekend but lemonade was like 11 bucks
Daniel Strizhevsky: is there insurance they include with this place?
Daniel Strizhevsky: if so, let's just do that. if not, let's just do lemonade
Daniel Strizhevsky: i have a soft spot for fintech startups
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is very long
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I can not read all of it tonight
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Will finish signing tomorrow
Yuta Baba: I actually enojoyed reading some of it
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We must return the apartment in the same state of cleanliness that we got it in
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Any cleaning costs will be billed 100% to us
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Hopefully they don’t try to screw us over like metropolitan did
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Cleaning is separate from normal wear and tear
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have a worryingly long section on bedbugs
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No drones allowed in the common areas Strizhevsky. Hope that’s not a dealbreaker
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I don’t know how they would regulate this but they say you can only have overnight guests for at most 7 nights per month
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And no more than 2 overnight guests at a time
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They also dedicated more than a page to talking about mold
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I feel like they’ve had to fumigate for bedbugs or something before
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The last page is saying the building has been treated with pesticides
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Anyway I completed signing so @Daniel Strizhevsky the gate of the universe rests on your shoulders
Yuta Baba: Is this 7 nights for each person? Or per room
Yuta Baba: I couldn’t tell from the agreement but I signed it anyway lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a gif.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Now that we have all signed the lease are they going to send us anything?
Yuta Baba: They are waiting for these
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to do the renters insurance and PG&E tonight?
Yuta Baba: Sure
Chris Acker: What does it mean by bring a copy of a government issued ID
Chris Acker: Does that mean we need to make a copy and give it to them
Yuta Baba: Take a copy of a driving license
Yuta Baba: Yes
Chris Acker: Or we just need to show it on arrival
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you think it's $100k total in personal liability coverage? or each
Chris Acker: I would assume it’s total
Daniel Strizhevsky: peepoo peepoo. i guess we should ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: as it will affect or Lemons
Chris Acker: We should also consider whether we want to get a joint policy, or all get our own
Chris Acker: I read that using a joint policy can come with “complexities”
Daniel Strizhevsky: i've previously used individual policies, don't really know about joint policies. i think it may have been cheaper to do individual
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: Ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah joint can be p complicated I agree
Yuta Baba: One time I did a joint phone bill and it was a mess
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: i have some Good News on our decision btw

Chris Acker: I called the fire department and they pumped it out
Chris Acker: Now we have to replace all the floor and walls and feeling
Chris Acker: Ceiling
Daniel Strizhevsky: holy cow that looks like a lot
Yuta Baba: Omg
Daniel Strizhevsky: surely you rentees aren't paying for it???
Chris Acker: No the homeowner has insurance
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok good
Daniel Strizhevsky: this makes me feel better about our decision to choose an apartment and not a house
Daniel Strizhevsky: how much do you have to be involved in all hte fixing
Chris Acker: I’m not sure how involved  i had to be, but I am currently the most involved lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: sad
Chris Acker: Our rental company organized the cleaners, plumbers, etc, and I’ve spent all day “supervising” them
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Daniel Strizhevsky: did you tell your roommates you're moving out btw
Chris Acker: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: It sucks because it’s difficult to sell my room when this is happening
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah this seems quite unfortunate :(
Daniel Strizhevsky: is the other room still pending
Chris Acker: No we got a dude from Tesla to take that
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: On the way here, his flight got delayed twice, then he missed it the third time, and when we finally got here, he locked himself out of his room.  So we had to call a locksmith to get him in. But the locksmith couldn’t fix the lock so he just broke the knob off.  So now he is knobless.  And then this happened like the next day.  I was yelling at him to keep bailing water and he’s like “I’m so tired 😞 “ and I’m like KEEP BAILING”
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: And now the house is destroyed
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh man that is quite a sad time for tesla man
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lolololol
Chris Acker: Yeah he probably hates us by this point lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I’m just imagining like it’s you and this dude on a small boat in the ocean
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And you tell him to keep bailing water
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad move in time for him though
Chris Acker: BAIILLLLLLLLL
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: man deserves 1 day free rent
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe even 1.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Chris Acker: Yeah and now that I’m leaving if they don’t find a person (and it will be difficult to find a person in this situation) the other guys will likely have to share the cost of my rent
Chris Acker: And this Tesla guy already had to pay 250 for the locksmith
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: man couldn't unlock the door and still charged 250???
Chris Acker: And he’s just an intern so he got this room so that he could live cheaply lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also like
Daniel Strizhevsky: shouldn't more of this be on the landlord to like
Daniel Strizhevsky: deal with
Chris Acker: I think that included the new knob, but the landlord will probably pay him back for that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol to be fair man locked himself out of his own room
Chris Acker: Yeah it was weird
Chris Acker: Because his doorknob had the same kind of lock that is there on an outside door
Chris Acker: Like the door that leads into your house
Chris Acker: Usually doors on the inside just have a little hole right
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Chris Acker: So he assumed that the house key also worked for his door
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: It did not
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait so like
Daniel Strizhevsky: it's just a not-unlockable door??
Chris Acker: And no one knew where the actual key was because this house is 60 years old
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh wow
Chris Acker: You can lock/unlock it from the inside
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also locksmith sounds like he isn’t that good though
Chris Acker: Cuz there is just a twisty thing like normal
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like aren’t most locks just deterrents
Chris Acker: The lock was so old that the pins were rusted
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: So he couldn’t use the usual tricks
Chris Acker: I’m not even sure if the key would have worked
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm sure LockPickingLawyer would have unlocked it in under a minute
Chris Acker reacted with 😮
Samvrutha Tumuluru: ^for sure
Chris Acker shared a video.
Yuta Baba: Holy moly I missed so much

Daniel Strizhevsky: both our and @Chris's cars are pretty small lol but we should be able to fit any medium sized stuff or smaller
Daniel Strizhevsky: is there any really large stuff anyone needs to move? like are either of you considering a uhaul or something?
Chris Acker: I was going to hire a moving company
Daniel Strizhevsky: for like desk and bed adn stuff?

Daniel Strizhevsky: what is your opinion on doing things once fully vaccinated?
Daniel Strizhevsky: i will be going into the office occasionally (or frequently maybe)
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess you already do too
Yuta Baba: I’ll be getting the second shot on 21st
Yuta Baba: So fingers crossed I can move the next day
Yuta Baba: In terms of work I’ll be wfh till at least July and I don’t think I have to go into the office until later this year
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: And yes I’m getting the mover as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you comfortable with us going to the office before you're fully vaccinated?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I can probably find a way around it if not
Yuta Baba: You mean the first two weeks or so?
Yuta Baba: Until the second vaccines in effect?
Chris Acker: I think if you wear a mask and everyone else is wearing a mask it should be fine
Yuta Baba: Yeah agreed
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: While I am not fully vaccinated
Yuta Baba: And maybe shower after u come back
Chris Acker: I mean really even after that
Chris Acker: We should be wearing masks in public for a while regardless
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: According to the cdc
Yuta Baba: True
Yuta Baba: The way I live won’t change just cuz I get vaccinated
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee
Daniel Strizhevsky: But you can like

Chris Acker: Sounds sketchy
Chris Acker: Is it individuals reaching out or companies?
Yuta Baba: Companies
Yuta Baba: Could be family owned tho
Chris Acker: Oh alright
Chris Acker: What was your quote
Yuta Baba: 100-200 per hour
Yuta Baba: Some require 3 hours minimum others 2 hours
Yuta Baba: And I don’t think I need 2 hours
Yuta Baba: Just cuz my place is so close
Yuta Baba: So I guess the plan is to go there early morning and get the keys etc and have my mover help with my move on 22nd
Chris Acker: Okay
Chris Acker: I think Rounak was able to move for way cheaper than that so I’ll ask him who he used
Yuta Baba: Wait what
Yuta Baba: I wanna know too
Yuta Baba: Cheaper than 100?
Yuta Baba: That’s kinda insane
Chris Acker: Okay he said it was also about 100
Yuta Baba: Oh ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah makes sense
Yuta Baba: I m using a mover around that price
Chris Acker: Hmm but a U-Haul is only 20 dollars total lol
Chris Acker: Not sure if this is worth it...
Chris Acker: Maybe it is
Chris Acker: If it’s minimum 3 hours I might just get a U-Haul
Yuta Baba: There is a mover w minimum 2 hours
Yuta Baba: I’m getting a shot the day before I don’t wanna move stuff by myself
Yuta Baba: I’ll just pay
Chris Acker sent a sticker.
Chris Acker: I'll actually probably move on the 23rd, because then I can prepare on the previous day
Chris Acker: like, get the key, and use saturday to pack my things a bit at my current place
Yuta Baba: Yeah that would be ideal but Sunday is more filled up
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to do insurance stuff tonight or shall we put that off to tomorrow?
Chris Acker: It looks like @Daniel Strizhevskyand @Samvrutha Tumuluru may not be available rn
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to meet at 7pm tomorrow?

Yuta Baba: I hired a mover I don’t have to do anything

Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think my side effects were worse than Dan’s but I could hardly make toast for myself
Yuta Baba: Oh yikes

Chris Acker: The ones they give you for free that you return are usually pretty bad I believe
Chris Acker: You can ask them about that
Chris Acker: Or I guess you rent them, not get them for free, but yeah still bad
Daniel Strizhevsky: it's an EPON fiber optic router apparently

Daniel Strizhevsky: I have 2 $100 bills
Daniel Strizhevsky: Where would you like me to go sir
Yuta Baba: Is 200 dollar enough to pay?
Yuta Baba: Mine only cost me 262
Chris Acker: Wait 100 dollars per person per hour right
Yuta Baba: You would prob take more than 2 hours so
Yuta Baba: You need to double check w them
Chris Acker: I have two people
Yuta Baba: I got 2 people, 100 bucks per hour
Yuta Baba: In total of 262 with all the service fees
Chris Acker: Wait so 50 per persons?
Yuta Baba: For me yes
Chris Acker: Wow dang
Chris Acker: That’s good
Yuta Baba: But you need to double check
Yuta Baba: Yes Ik
Chris Acker: Double check how long they think it will take?
Yuta Baba: So I have a tip
Yuta Baba: Mine took 1 hour and 45 min
Yuta Baba: But I had all the boxes in the hallway
Yuta Baba: They didn’t need to go up stairs so I would say you’ll take about 3 hours
Yuta Baba: Plus the driving
Yuta Baba: Prob 3-3.5?
Chris Acker: Yeah I have a 30 dollar truck charge
Yuta Baba: And you’ll have to pay some service fees
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba can I poop in your bathroom
Chris Acker: And then 10 dollar tip per person per hour
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: Wtf
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: No
Daniel Strizhevsky: You already said yes
Daniel Strizhevsky: Too late
Yuta Baba: Go ahead
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Yeah my movers thought they have 3 hour minimum but I only did 2 hour minimum so I payed 300
Chris Acker: What does that mean lol
Chris Acker: How did they think they had a 3 hour minimum
Yuta Baba: That’s the standard for them
Chris Acker: 3 hour minimum means you pay for three hours
Yuta Baba: But I negotiated so I get 2 hour minimum
Chris Acker: Even if it took shorter
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: And I knew it wouldn’t take 3 hours so I negotiated
Chris Acker: Oh I see
Yuta Baba: And made it two hour minimum and it was done under 2 hours
Yuta Baba: Worked out perfectly
Yuta Baba: But for your case you’ll go over two hours for sure
Yuta Baba: Just cuz of the additional trip you have to make from Los Altos
Yuta Baba: So you have to ask them how much per hour
Yuta Baba: If it’s 100 bucks for two ppl then 600 should be enough
Yuta Baba: I also have extra 50 if needed
Yuta Baba: But if one person 100 bucks per hour then that’s a different story
Chris Acker: Yeah it’s one person 100 bucks
Yuta Baba: Ok so 3.5 hours = $700
Truck = $30
Some miscellaneous fee = $50
Tip = $70
Yuta Baba: Are they almost done with loading your stuff?
Chris Acker: They they are done
Chris Acker: We are coming now
Yuta Baba: Oh perfect
Yuta Baba: It’s not gon take 3.5 hours
Yuta Baba: Prob 3 hours

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Should we just take it?
Chris Acker: What if it doesn’t work with our tv and then we have to take it
Yuta Baba: Also Sasha declines our 160 dollar offer
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: D*declined
Samvrutha Tumuluru: True
Yuta Baba: 180?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I guess we lowballed him too hard
Yuta Baba: Or should we wait on Chris’s side
Chris Acker: Can you ask what TVs it works for
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We can try but idk if we can cancel the other stuff
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah I asked for the dimensions
Chris Acker: But the thing that holds the tv is that back panel
Chris Acker: The two metal bars are screwed into the tv
Chris Acker: Our the needs to have screw holes in the back that are the same width as those two bars
Chris Acker: Tv*

Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol how long did that take to type in
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmmm
Daniel Strizhevsky: The box doesn't fit on our balcony storage?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can see when we get back

Chris Acker: Yeah
Yuta Baba: Yeah but bigger but this video is v helpful
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah a bit bigger and a few more drawers
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But I like the general style
Chris Acker shared a video.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I like that one
Daniel Strizhevsky: Does it not need to be deeper to fit your coffee stuff?
Yuta Baba: I still like something a bit longer but if we can’t find any, this looks good to me!
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I can also look into other options as well
Chris Acker: It’s 15 inches which seems to fit my espresso machine snugly

Chris Acker: And you just split that with as many people as are on the plan
Chris Acker: You should hop on Samvrutha’s family plan
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah i think it's like 16
Daniel Strizhevsky: hers only has 3 ppl so i dont wanna pay that much lol but if you're on one with your actual family it probably doesn't make sense to do a house one
Chris Acker: 4 dollars is too much? Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: yes sir
Daniel Strizhevsky: i prefer 2.66
Chris Acker: Yeah I’d feel bad about abandoning my family

Daniel Strizhevsky: So the second one-samvrutha
Chris Acker: Like the part yuta is sitting on
Chris Acker: The one in the image is a 3x2 but it comes in 2x2
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: The 3x2 would be a little too expensive and too large
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah 3*2 seems big
Daniel Strizhevsky: Does it come in a lighter color
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👎
Chris Acker: Or we can do something like this
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh interesting but then no one would sit on the side couch
Daniel Strizhevsky: We would all have to squeeze on one couch anyway
Chris Acker: Would you rather something like this
Chris Acker: Or the 2x2 style
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think 2*2 would be first choice
Daniel Strizhevsky: But I don't dislike this other style
Daniel Strizhevsky: How much is it?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can yuta sit on this for scale
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: This was samvrutha btw
Daniel Strizhevsky: Reading now

Chris Acker: It’s 120 inches
Chris Acker: So a bit large
Chris Acker: For our place
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: This one is the same but 112
Daniel Strizhevsky: Not really a fan of this
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is this comfortable?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yuta on this for size
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also yeah which is the most comfy
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah we can't fit 120
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think that's not an option
Chris Acker: They are all very comfy
Chris Acker: Mich comfier than IKEA ones
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ❤
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Is this the only color or are there other options
Daniel Strizhevsky: I didn't know that was possible
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also what would be the dimensions of the 2*2 version
Daniel Strizhevsky: Remember that our 96" fake couch fit fairly snugly
Daniel Strizhevsky: I don't think we can go past 100 or so
Chris Acker: 99
Chris Acker: Would be the 2*2 version
Chris Acker: Do you guys want to take a look on living spaces website
Chris Acker: For sectionals
Chris Acker: While we are here
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: 98
Daniel Strizhevsky: Our internet is bad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is that 98 big enough for 4 to fit on?
Chris Acker: If we squeeze
Chris Acker: But the fourth could pull up a bad stool
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmmm
Chris Acker: We are always going to be limited by this 100 inch constraint right
Chris Acker: And with the 2x2 the 4th person can’t watch tv
Chris Acker: Because they are too close right
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why did the 96 feel so large then
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe the armrests were smaller
Daniel Strizhevsky: Our internet is very spotty rn so don't wait for us
Daniel Strizhevsky: Poopa
Chris Acker: Hmmm
Daniel Strizhevsky: I thought we thought that person was fine
Chris Acker: I guess we will not be getting a couch
Chris Acker: I’ll be gone next weekend as well
Chris Acker: Because my friends are coming
Chris Acker: Yuta might be gone too
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why
Chris Acker: Why what
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why will we not be getting a couch
Chris Acker: Yuta and I cannot find one that markets the requirements
Chris Acker: There are no 2x2 that are light colored
Chris Acker: Light color sofas are Rare
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think this one will be that bad?
Yuta Baba: I am all for this one
Daniel Strizhevsky: If it's very comfy and you think we can fit reasonably I'm ok
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What is wrong with this one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would rather all be able to sit comfortably than have a light colored couch
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This does not look like we can all sit comfortably
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I’m down to get this one
Chris Acker: That one is not quite as comfortable as the sofas
Chris Acker: And it’s a bit more pricey
Chris Acker: At 995
Chris Acker: There were some large sofas for like 800 and very comfortable
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think color should be tertiary to comfort and proper size
Chris Acker: Also with the 2x2, it’s hard for the 4th person to watch tv, and the two in the middle’s knees will collide
Chris Acker: With the sofa, we might all be a bit squeezed at full capacity, but tv watching is good, and no knee touching
Chris Acker: And if we are that unconmfortable Someone can pull up a bar stool
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Are you guys okay with the color
Chris Acker: It does not come in another color
Daniel Strizhevsky: What size is this? Looks pretty big
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes
Yuta Baba: 90 something

Chris Acker: Second one is more comfortable and has better colors
Chris Acker: But 4 people would be a bit snug
Chris Acker: The salesperson says these might sell out quickly, so we should buy soon, and he says you can get a refund up to two days before delivery
Daniel Strizhevsky: What dimensions are the big one?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can we get a yuta for size on the little one
Chris Acker: 99 x 99
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmmm yeah that one seems a bit small
Chris Acker: Okay
Chris Acker: Should we just pay the 995
Chris Acker: I’m fine with that
Chris Acker: As long as you like the color
Chris Acker: In terms of comfort the big one is a little firmer than I’d like, but it’s not a deal breaker for me
Daniel Strizhevsky: How comfortable is the big one compared to UPPLAND?
Daniel Strizhevsky: If it's like a lot worse than UPPLAND then maybe it's not worth, but if it's similar then it'll be the same price right? So might as well?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I prefer big
Chris Acker: Yuta thinks it’s better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Small is not big enough for us to sit
Chris Acker: I don’t remember tbh
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sales man is just trying to scare us
Chris Acker: I mean if we can get a full refund why scare us lol
Chris Acker: Isn’t it valid
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is it as firm as our old couch?
Chris Acker: No
Chris Acker: It’s a nice couch
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Because he knows that most people won’t go through the hassle
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: The last one was firm cuz it was cheap
Chris Acker: This one was firm by design
Chris Acker: I mean
Yuta Baba: But it has a nice back support
Chris Acker: Every single ikea couch is sold out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I guess if it's similar to UPPLAND I'm ok with it but if it's worse then I'd probably rather wait for uppland
Chris Acker: And most of the couches here are sold out
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah my coworker was saying most furniture is on like a multi-minth backorder
Daniel Strizhevsky: Month
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I agree with what Dan said
Chris Acker: Yeah they said 6 months for most of these couches
Chris Acker: And that is for the ones that are in stock
Chris Acker: They said these two were available immediately
Yuta Baba: IKEA online is not great
Yuta Baba: I’ve ordered a drawer and it never came
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: Chris do you really dislike the big boy?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: What are the dimensions
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky @Samvrutha Tumuluru u two ok with this?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you like that or walnut
Daniel Strizhevsky: I feel like walnut is better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I like the white
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The walnut in the picture looks like it will look fake
Yuta Baba: 39*23
Chris Acker: I like the idea of walnut better but I’m afraid it will look weird and cheap
Chris Acker: I think white is a safer option
Yuta Baba: Remember that the couch is on the darker side
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My same thoughts
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ah ok let’s do white for sure
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 39 * 23 will fit in front of the couch right?

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan doesn’t like the white one I sent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But we both like this one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How much is the stand you already ordered?
Yuta Baba: Our TVs legs are at the end so we need a little bigger one
Chris Acker: It’s 131
Chris Acker: And 58” long
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah there is a bigger one in the link
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 60”
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Do you guys like or would prefer to stick with what we have
Chris Acker: I’m fine with yours
Chris Acker: Do you want the white one?
Chris Acker: Or the brown
Chris Acker: White?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan thinks brown will look better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I’m neutral
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think wood looks fake on the white one
Yuta Baba: The couch is on the darker side just so u know
Daniel Strizhevsky: Dark would be 60", white is 53"
Daniel Strizhevsky: Tv is 48"
Daniel Strizhevsky: We'd have slightly more space for speakers but idk if that would be too big
Daniel Strizhevsky: The dark one
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Meh fine let’s just do white
Daniel Strizhevsky: Like speakers wouldn't overlap the screen which is nice
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I’m sure it will look fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Let's just do the dark one then
Daniel Strizhevsky: Unless you guys think it won't fit
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Fine let’s do dark
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah dark looks better
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Tv is kinda too contrasted with the white
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think we should also just get the coffee table
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Even with the shipping fee
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It’s pretty cheap

Chris Acker: Might I interest you in walnut?
Yuta Baba: I’d be down
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sure
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Will match our tv stand
Yuta Baba: For the hallway how about this
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: It doesn’t come with the drawers but the sizing is as good as we can give I think
Yuta Baba: *find
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I’m just afraid it will look messy without drawers
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But with all our electronics and such
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What measurement do we want again
Yuta Baba: 70*29 I think?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Isn't 13.4 too small for Chris's thing
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or almost too small I guess
Yuta Baba: I think he can live w it
Yuta Baba: The whole thing doesn’t need to be on the table
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Idk we don’t want it to be precarious
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also it will look silly if the coffee thing is hanging off
Chris Acker: It will fit on that
Chris Acker: Just about
Chris Acker: I think it’s 12.5
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: There is also this
Chris Acker: But the problem is that it’s very short

Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it’s probably fine then I’m fine with it
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It seems most others will be out of our price range

Daniel Strizhevsky: I think having to enter through veterans Blvd would be a minus
Chris Acker: Hmm idk
Chris Acker: Coming north on veterans it’s certainly more convenient
Chris Acker: More convenient leaving for 101 as well
Chris Acker: Which is probably our main destination
Daniel Strizhevsky: There's more traffic though and an extra 1 or 2 lights I think
Daniel Strizhevsky: How will you go south?
Daniel Strizhevsky: You'd have to turn around when going south or coming back from north right
Daniel Strizhevsky: While around the back is fine coming from either direction
Chris Acker: Yeah but I’ve never gone south before lol
Chris Acker: Have you?
Chris Acker: What is south?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh true I guess you go north to go south
Chris Acker: And I don’t think the traffic is that bad
Daniel Strizhevsky: Still coming back from 101 is worse on it
Chris Acker: Because there are a lot of lanes
Chris Acker: No it’s not
Chris Acker: Because you come back from the south
Chris Acker: That northern entrance is only an entrance
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh I come back from the north
Daniel Strizhevsky: Onto veterans
Daniel Strizhevsky: Actually even going north from veterans is technically worse cause there are 2 extra traffic lights
Chris Acker: Oh I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: bussin
Chris Acker: I mean, with the lights it’s hit or miss
Chris Acker: When the light is red, Main Street would have been faster
Chris Acker: When it is green, veterans will be faster
Daniel Strizhevsky: Tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: Idk I generally prefer using a more quiet side street
Chris Acker: And there is no in n out line blocking
Chris Acker: Are you guys interested in the garbáge spot
Daniel Strizhevsky: I may have to take a look see myself

Daniel Strizhevsky: i have ordered a Peeler, Sharp enough to painless remove a layer of Thumb if needed according to amazon reviews
Daniel Strizhevsky: painlessly*
Yuta Baba: Does that mean the current peeler at home is safer?!?!
Daniel Strizhevsky: No I think peeler at home can do so painfully instead of painlessly
Yuta Baba: Ahhhh improvement I wanted to see
Daniel Strizhevsky: lso the blades are super sharp - while rinsing under a sink, I ran my thumb lightly over what I thought was the blunt metal edge of the peeler to make sure the sticky mango juice was not remaining but I got too close to the blade by accident and it peeled off a piece of my thumb. Thankfully, even that was so thin, I didn't even bleed and it didn't even get deep enough for me to get pain like with a papercut - it literally just sliced off a piece of my top skin without hitting any nerves. With this type of sharp, thin slicing, I might have to get another one to try it on the calluses of my feet!

Yuta Baba: Can I distribute to all three?
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Chris Acker: I don’t want to cause a skirmish here because I really don’t care that much, and it’s not like it’s a lot of money or anything.  But in my opinion, I think that we should all split evenly the charges that are not usage based (i.e. garbage).  For things that are usage based like water and electricity, it makes sense that only the people living in the apartment are paying.
Chris Acker: Like, if all four of us were out for a month, would no one pay?
Yuta Baba: I’d be ok w that as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think that's fair

Yuta Baba: Chris and me
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: What happened to that film
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I have not heard of this
Yuta Baba reacted with 😢
Chris Acker: I like how your mom dressed up to go out into nature to cut down a papaya, which is opposite from the conventional logic of dressing up to feel apart from nature, and integrated with the rest of society.  Rather, your mom dressed in nature colors, specifically those of a papaya, to symbolize that she was trying to integrate into nature itself.  But then the film turns itself on its head. In trying to fit in with nature, your mom encountered physical limitations which prevented her from realizing her goals.  And it was your dad, who was in common clothing, not striving to fit in, who had the tools necessary to pluck the papaya from the tree. And in the end we are left to think: how do we select the cultures we choose to integrate with, and it is right to change ourselves for them, even if the change itself seems harmless?

Daniel Strizhevsky: Also should we ask Kenny if his flight is refundable? Don't want to scare him but I think we should inform him ahead of time that we are somewhat considering postponing the trip
Yuta Baba: Postponing the trip?
Yuta Baba: I prob won’t be able to go
Yuta Baba: If we do that
Yuta Baba: Until prob like late feb
Daniel Strizhevsky: Not saying we will
Daniel Strizhevsky: But better for Kenny to think about it
Yuta Baba: Tru tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm just thinking about whether it will be peak COVID cases or not
Yuta Baba: Prob it will die down
Yuta Baba: We still have 2 more weeks
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah

Yuta Baba: Should we get a car?
Yuta Baba: We still haven’t booked it yet
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is car cancelable
Yuta Baba: Can u check? It’s your Audi turo right
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh I thought we were doing hertz or w/e
Daniel Strizhevsky: Seems like turo is refundable up to 24 hours before the booking time
Yuta Baba: We won’t be able to decide for a while tho
Yuta Baba: We will need more than 24 hours
Yuta Baba: Should we reach out to the renter to show the interest and let us know if someone is trying to book?
Chris Acker: Why will we need more than 24 hours before the booking time
Chris Acker: That’s one day before
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Misread
Yuta Baba: I thought booking time = when you book the car
Yuta Baba: And I thought it’s after not before
Yuta Baba: My bad
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevsky is it 24 hours before the booked time, or within 24 hours after the time you book

Yuta Baba: @Chris, when you come back from your ski trip, can you please book the PCR test somewhere a few days after you come back just in case? Which test kit did you buy? We will be actually away from Encore until next Sunday to take advantage of the long weekend. Hope you enjoy your family time and skiing!
Chris Acker: I got the only test available online, the flow flex
Chris Acker: I looked at cvs pcr tests but they are completely booked for the next few weeks
Chris Acker: Let me know if you guys can find one because we should all take one
Chris Acker: We’re you able to get those rapid tests online yuta?
Yuta Baba: I got what Dan used last time and it will arrive in a few days I think m
Yuta Baba: I’ll look into some test sites
Yuta Baba: Stanford has some shots from 1/24
Yuta Baba: There are some slots available in emeryville on 1/21 Friday.
Chris Acker: Oh I forgot they did testing
Chris Acker: Let me check my Stanford app
Yuta Baba: Do you think you can take one on 1/21?
Yuta Baba: Emeryville is a bit far away tho it’s close to Berkeley

Chris Acker: Hi @Yuta Babarton, I started an email between all of us, including Zach, and moises so that we can get this lease stuff done
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Just sent the doc with the date on to Moises
Chris Acker: He says that you will have to get your release form signing notarized.  Are you able to do that in Japan?
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Annoying
Chris Acker: Yeah :(
Yuta Baba: I didn’t even know what notarized document mean so I ignored it
Yuta Baba: Lol
Chris Acker: Lol yeah i don’t know how it works in Japan but in the US there are notarization services
Chris Acker: They watch you sign the document, and give you another document saying that they watched you sign it
Chris Acker: To verify authenticity
Yuta Baba: There are some notarization service online
Yuta Baba: Let’s see if he can take that
Chris Acker: Oh nice
Chris Acker: 🍌
Yuta Baba: When is Zach moving in
Yuta Baba: My stuff needs to be shipped before that right
Chris Acker: Hmm if it’s too annoying to notarize maybe we can keep @Yuta Baba on the lease as there is only one month left
Chris Acker: They might let us add Zach regardless
Yuta Baba: I would rather not pay $1550 so I’ll get it notarized
Yuta Baba: But my worry is my stuff
Chris Acker: I mean we wouldn’t make you pay lol
Chris Acker: Zach would pay and we’d adjust your contribution to $0
Chris Acker: You would just still be financially liable for the apartment
Chris Acker: Zach was planning on moving in May
Chris Acker: (Beginning of May or end of April)
Chris Acker: He says not to worry about your stuff
Yuta Baba: I might not be able to use my benefit card as I won’t be a resident in May 🥲
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky

Yuta Baba: Have u got any other mails
Chris Acker: Nothing important, just this one
Chris Acker: It is a notification from Cigna that they are covering 70% of the cost of the covid test you got before flying back to Japan
Chris Acker: You will owe the test site you went to the remaining balance of $86.63
Chris Acker: That testing site (or doctors office) will charge you directly.  This letter is just a notice that they covered the 70 percent
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: Hmmm interesting
Yuta Baba: I already paid the whole amount of 295

Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba do you want your Magigo Home coasters?
Yuta Baba: Hmmmmm
Yuta Baba: Yeah sure
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yes sir you will get them
Yuta Baba: Thank uuuu
Daniel Strizhevsky: @yyta tababa we have some bad news
Daniel Strizhevsky: The boxes will probably be >$500 each
Daniel Strizhevsky: To ship
Daniel Strizhevsky: So up to you but we may need to do some research and possibly rethink what to ship/not ship
Yuta Baba: Hmmmmm
Yuta Baba: Is that USPS that you were thinking of using?
Yuta Baba: First-Class Package International Service might be the cheapest?
Yuta Baba: I don’t care how long it takes but the cheapest option would be ideal
Chris Acker: Yeah First Class International packager service by usps is the cheapest we have found.  It would probably cost about $1,500 to $2,000 to send everything
Chris Acker: Are you okay with paying that much?
Yuta Baba: Ok let’s toss a lot of things
Yuta Baba: How many boxes are you estimating
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: 2 extra large boxes
Chris Acker: Which are 21 inches x 24 inches x 20 inches
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: And one large box
Yuta Baba: Wait
Yuta Baba: Three boxes and it will cost 1500?
Chris Acker: Which is 15 inches x 16 inches x 27 inches
Yuta Baba: That’s ducking insane
Chris Acker: Yeah it’s very expensive to ship to Japan
Chris Acker: And each weighs 50 - 75 pounds
Yuta Baba: If we use smaller boxes less weight would that change the price
Chris Acker: Not sure
Chris Acker: You can go to usps website and play around with the pricing calculator
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Let’s do 3-4 boxes
Yuta Baba: Large
Yuta Baba: 15*16**27
Yuta Baba: Each 30 pounds
Yuta Baba: The rest I need to toss
Yuta Baba: Wait I can’t use priority mail international right
Yuta Baba: Can I?
Yuta Baba: In the photo
Chris Acker: Why not?
Yuta Baba: It’s not for a mail right?
Yuta Baba: I can actually send a box?
Yuta Baba: Then the total cost will be 600-800, I think that’s p reasonable
Chris Acker: It says “max length 60 inches” under it which has to mean box
Yuta Baba: My bed & Dyson and monitor should be able to offset all the cost
Yuta Baba: Does it take 15*16*27?
Yuta Baba: Or the whole length needs to be 60 inches?
Yuta Baba: Like a fedex mail?
Chris Acker: Max length means it just has to be less than 60
Yuta Baba: Like just one side?
Yuta Baba: Then it should be ok right
Yuta Baba: Ok let’s aim for 3 boxes I’m sure I can toss a lot of my clothes
Chris Acker: Yeah that should be fine
Chris Acker: Okay but your books alone are probably more than 30
Chris Acker: Are you okay with tossing those?
Yuta Baba: Hmmm books need to go into multiple boxes
Yuta Baba: I don’t want to toss books
Chris Acker: Some things it might be cheaper to buy again though lol
Yuta Baba: I have a lot to toss anyway let’s keep books for now
Yuta Baba: It’s time to kill all of my clothes tbh
Yuta Baba: I think I brought back most of the stuff I need
Yuta Baba: So I only need to pick a few clothes I need
Yuta Baba: And im gonna toss the blankies
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Yuta Baba: Except for the nicest one
Yuta Baba: Can we do another video call this weekend?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: Yep, we can do a live packing call
Chris Acker: So you can decide what goes in the box
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I sent Moises the notarized doc
Chris Acker: Thanks!
Yuta Baba: Is everything moving forward?
Chris Acker: Yeah I think we should be good to go with Zach’s move in
Yuta Baba: Awesome
Chris Acker: Maybe during the call this weekend you and Zach can also negotiate prices for anything Zach wants to buy in your room
Yuta Baba: Yeah sure
Yuta Baba: Has Zach already moved in?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No he is planning on moving in next weekend
Yuta Baba: Sounds gucci
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Yuta Baba Dan and I are going to Tahoe this weekend (leaving Friday after work)

Chris Acker: I believe Zach will pay
Chris Acker: As he will be living here
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will now create a Zach + baba chat for furniture discussions
Yuta Baba: Just curious
Yuta Baba: Is my Alexa in the boxes you guys are shipping?
Chris Acker: Yeah I think so
Yuta Baba: Perf! Thanks!
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba we tried to send the packages today but they did not let us for two reasons:
1. They were too large, so we are going to try and pack things into smaller boxes
2. We need to declare everything on a customs form (basically list everything that we are sending)
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba one more thing
Chris Acker: We were looking at Yamato TA-Q-BIN service and it might be cheaper…
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: https://c2c.yamatoamerica.com/Customer/CREATE
Chris Acker shared a link.
Chris Acker: The guy at USPS also recommended Yamato for sending to Japan
Chris Acker: He said it’s often cheaper through them
Yuta Baba: Oh damn thanks for doing that
Yuta Baba: Did the large box work or do you have to use a smaller box for it too?
Yuta Baba: The list sounds tricky tho… and a lot of work
Chris Acker: I think the large box should be fine
Chris Acker: Just the extra large boxes might be too large
Yuta Baba: Hmmm ok I tried it
Yuta Baba: With the size of the large boxes
Yuta Baba: & 50 pounds (the maximum weight we can ship)
Yuta Baba: It’s like 234 bucks so not bad might be a bit cheaper
Chris Acker: Yeah but that’s after taxes right
Chris Acker: When it did it it was like in the 190s pre tax
Yuta Baba: Yeah should be after tax
Chris Acker: Whereas I thought the price we did for USPS was pre tax?
Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Yeah this is way cheaper then
Yuta Baba: Can you use ta q bin besso? I think it has some tax advantages I can use
Chris Acker: Yeah i think so, right?
Yuta Baba: Perfect!
Yuta Baba: I know it’s a lot of work to do… thanks for doing everything for me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Yuta Baba can you fill out all the forms for us our Japanese isn’t so good 😅
Yuta Baba: Yeah of course
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Maybe we do another call
Samvrutha Tumuluru: To itemize for customs?
Chris Acker: We can fill it out at the same time
Yuta Baba: Kk
Chris Acker: Everything is done online
Chris Acker: I don’t think they will then pick it up from our apartment?
Chris Acker: I think*
Yuta Baba: I can make an account for myself as well
Chris Acker: Yeah then you could pay directly
Yuta Baba: And everything needs to fit under 50 pounds so I need to toss some
Chris Acker: But we will need to help you with the customs info
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: As we have all of your stuff
Chris Acker: Yeah so we will need to Redbox
Chris Acker: Re-box*
Yuta Baba: And yes you need to take either Yamato shop or ups/upss
Chris Acker: While we are re-boxing we can create the customs list
Yuta Baba: Sounds good
Yuta Baba: When would be the good time to do it?
Yuta Baba: I should be available this weekend

Yuta Baba: Filling out the form rn
Yuta Baba: Just to double check
Yuta Baba: All the boxes are under 55 pounds each right

Chris Acker: but no rush

Yuta Baba: Oh
Yuta Baba: Okie
Yuta Baba: I’ll get it done anyway so that you can go whenever you want
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Chris Acker I think the thing you saw in San Mateo was Suruki supermarket

Samvrutha Tumuluru: The supermarket is open tomorrow but not sure how likely they are to take our boxes
Yuta Baba: Actually I need to call Yamato on Monday
Yuta Baba: I’m not sure if I’m understanding the implications at custom
Yuta Baba: And I might have to change the name of the sender to one of you guys
Yuta Baba: They require me to submit the id info
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker can you let me know what happened to my reimbursement for COVID test?
Chris Acker: You never got the reimbursement?
Chris Acker: If you didn’t you should call your insurance company
Yuta Baba: Can you send me the letter they sent me?
Yuta Baba: I can’t use my US number and I can’t even log into the app
Yuta Baba: And don’t want to call them cuz international phone pricey
Yuta Baba: Actually jk you sent me the letter
Yuta Baba: Can you send me the transaction number or something?
Yuta Baba: The photo doesn’t have that
Yuta Baba: Only if u still keep that letter tho
Chris Acker: I don’t have the letter anymore
Chris Acker: Do you see the bill on your credit card?
Chris Acker: Why would your insurance company say they paid for it if you did?
Chris Acker: That’s very abnormal
Chris Acker: Usually you don’t pay directly
Chris Acker: You just give your insurance
Yuta Baba: Yea
Chris Acker: But if you want to access your insurance account you can use a VPN right?
Yuta Baba: no I need a phone number for MFA
Yuta Baba: I do have a vpn
Yuta Baba: But need a phone
Chris Acker: Try using google voice to get a US phone number?
Chris Acker: You can use a virtual phone number with google voice
Chris Acker: When we we to Japan in 2018, we made all the reservation and did calls over a google voice number
Chris Acker: Calling is still fairly expensive tho
Yuta Baba: Yeah will look into it
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba did you call Yamato about the questions you had?
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: I learned that I cannot use besso
Yuta Baba: So I have to do another way of shipping via Yamato
Yuta Baba: So I will have to redo making the label
Chris Acker: Why not besso?  Do you think it is still better to use Yamato?
Chris Acker: Also did you get an answer for if it’s okay to put your name instead of our names
Chris Acker: For when we send it
Yuta Baba: Probably? With Besso I would have done it when I flew back to Japan
Yuta Baba: Besso has some advantage when it comes to custom
Yuta Baba: Ah I forgot
Yuta Baba: Probably I should use one of you guys names as the sender
Chris Acker: Okay, samvrutha is leaving on Friday so we have until Thursday our time to send it
Chris Acker: Cuz I’ll need help with the boxes
Chris Acker: And Dan is gone to New Jersey
Yuta Baba: Yeah I will do it tonight
Chris Acker: Okay cool 😎
Daniel Strizhevsky: 🍌
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky there is an item coins in box 1
Yuta Baba: Are they actual money?
Yuta Baba: Or can Chris confirm?
Yuta Baba: Can you take them out cuz I don’t think I can send money

Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba  our friend works for a bank in the US, and there are 3 businessmen coming from Japan to visit the company.  He is supposed to take them out to lunch.  Is there any etiquette that he should know about?  Like, should he buy them a welcome gift or something
Yuta Baba: Hmmmm actually I don’t know much about the business manner in jpn, but Im sure a small welcome gift would be nice (not mandatory at all)!
Yuta Baba: here is an article about it: https://www.gtalent.jp/blog/japanwork/others/japan-business-manners

Yuta Baba: This one is good about seating at a meeting/in an elevator
Yuta Baba: I think these would be nice to know!
Yuta Baba: And I’m sure they will notice it, which would probably smoothen the business convo as well
Chris Acker: Ooh thx
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello @Yuta Baba
Daniel Strizhevsky: We are discussing what to do with the communal furniture we all bought
Daniel Strizhevsky: And we were thinking that me, you, and @Samvrutha sell our shares in the furniture to Chris all at a 50% discount to the purchase price
Daniel Strizhevsky: So this would be the couch and TV and tables and all that. We paid a total of ~$650 each for all the furniture, so we'd each get $325 and @Chris would just own all the furniture in full
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think that's reasonable or do you have any thoughts??
Yuta Baba: Sounds good to me!
Yuta Baba: Also I don’t think I got a deposit back from encore, we paid the deposit right?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We haven't gotten it back yet

Chris Acker: Did you guys see the final account and moving form sent by encore
Chris Acker: What the heck is a final utility bill
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah just saw it
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's the utilities we haven't yet paid for I guess
Chris Acker: $376 closing utility bill
Chris Acker: We’re the utilities always that much?  I forget
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah looks like it's usually ~250/mo
Daniel Strizhevsky: And this was 1.5 months
Daniel Strizhevsky: So looks reasonable
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks basically like what I expected, except he said he usually doesn't charge for carpet cleaning lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess he wasn't feeling nice this time around
Chris Acker: lol
Chris Acker: Well looks like we still owe Encore a little bit of $
Chris Acker: We owe Encore $126.32, to be exact
Chris Acker: I think we also need to consider the fact that the above-mentioned closing utilities were paid in part by Yuta's deposit, which was never paid back to him.
Yuta Baba: Excuse meeeeee
Yuta Baba: But thanks for the info
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: Yuta obviously shouldn't pay for the utilities, but I think we can all split the cleaning fees based on the proportion of time we each spent at Encore?
Yuta Baba: Agreed
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I was gonna say that
Chris Acker: So those are the proportions
Chris Acker: In # of weeks spent at Encore
Chris Acker: Pls correct me if I'm wrong
Chris Acker: Sorry months
Yuta Baba: Sounds about right
Chris Acker: not weeks :)
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Multiplied by the charges, that is the amount that each of us owe
Chris Acker: Once again, correct me if I did any math incorrectly
Chris Acker: Which means that each of us can make the following payments, one to encore, and one to yuta

Yuta Baba: I’ll let u do whatever u want ofc hehe
Chris Acker reacted with 🙏
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Chris Acker your math looks reasonable
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you want to put the yuta payment in splitwise? and then for encore do we just pay the normal way?
Chris Acker: Is the Splitwise already paid off?  If so maybe we just Venmo?
Daniel Strizhevsky: no it's not paid off
Daniel Strizhevsky: and i wanna put the furtniture stuff in there
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait i think this doesn't add up
Daniel Strizhevsky: this says we're only paying like 39 each total, but the thingy says we each owe 50.5?
Daniel Strizhevsky: (we being you me and samvrutha)
Chris Acker: Hmm let me check
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh it might be the parking credit
Chris Acker: Wait no that’s right
Daniel Strizhevsky: that is causing the discrepancy
Chris Acker: Yeah exactly
Chris Acker: Calculating how much we all owe was just to get the proportion
Chris Acker: Of how much we each need to pay of the outstanding debts to encore and yuta
Chris Acker: I’ve invited you to the spreadsheet if you want to check
Chris Acker: Check your email
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah it looks right i'm just slightly confused about the parking credit
Daniel Strizhevsky: but it's small enough that idk if it's worth thinking about lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess i'll just start paying this^ ?
Daniel Strizhevsky: any last words??
Chris Acker: If you are okay about the parking credit then yes
Chris Acker: Has Samvrutha given her seal of approval
Chris Acker: And what about @Zach Gospe
Daniel Strizhevsky: samvrutha is on board
Chris Acker: Zach is playing D&D tonight
Daniel Strizhevsky: nerd lol
Chris Acker: Shall we wait for him to sign off?
Daniel Strizhevsky: sure
Yuta Baba: No rush on my end

Daniel Strizhevsky: how was this in the end
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok I will make a splitwise for the Yuta payments
