y. I will apologize to Wallace and his son. I never meant to cause any harm.

Angry Crowd Member: What's the kid's name anyway? It can't be that bad.

Groke: His name is Blue Loop.

[The crowd erupts into laughter]

Angry Crowd: Blue Loop? That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!
Daniel Strizhevsky: [The crowd starts making fun of Blue Loop, laughing and jeering at Groke]

Groke: [Trying to defend himself] I didn't name him that, it was his parents!

Angry Crowd: That doesn't excuse your behavior! You need to apologize and take responsibility for your actions!

[The footage ends with Groke being berated by the angry crowd]
Chris Acker: lol how did Blue loop come about
Daniel Strizhevsky: It remembered this from something like 15 chats ago
Daniel Strizhevsky: However, I am excited to announce a new venture that I am launching - TrackMania Poop Snacks! These delicious snacks are inspired by the world of TrackMania and are the perfect treat for any Grokestronaut.

Each bag of TrackMania Poop Snacks contains an assortment of tasty flavors, including Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast. They are made from all natural ingredients and are the perfect snack for gaming, streaming, or just enjoying with friends.
Daniel Strizhevsky: I glossed over this part lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Hey Groke,

Dude, I am so hyped about these new TrackMania Poop Snacks! I've been a huge fan of the game since it came out, and I can't wait to try these snacks.

I'm sure they're going to be so tasty, and the different flavors sound amazing. Blue Loop, Red Canyon, and Green Coast are my favorite tracks in the game, and now I can munch on snacks that taste like them while I'm playing.

I can't wait to get my hands on a bag of these snacks and munch on them while I'm streaming my gameplay. I'm sure all my fans are going to love them too.

Thanks for coming up with such a cool product, Groke!

Sincerely,
A High Fan of TrackMania and Poop Snacks

Chris Acker: INT. GROKERY - DAY

Blue Loop and the high fan of TrackMania Poop Snacks stand face to face, seething with anger. The air is tense and the sound of their heavy breathing fills the room.

BLUE LOOP: You have no right to call yourself a fan of TrackMania. You're just a cheat who uses drugs to give yourself an unfair advantage.

HIGH FAN: And you're just a washed-up has-been who can't handle the competition.

They both take a step forward, ready to throw a punch. But before they can, Daniel Striz bursts into the room.

DANIEL: Stop it, both of you! This isn't the way to settle your differences.

BLUE LOOP: Shut up, Striz. You're the reason we're in this mess.

HIGH FAN: Yeah, if it weren't for your shady business practices, we wouldn't be fighting over a stupid bag of snacks.

DANIEL: I know, I know. I'm sorry. But please, let's just calm down and talk this out like adults.

The two players reluctantly back away from each other, still glowering. Daniel takes a deep breath and starts to speak.

DANIEL: Look, I know I made a huge mistake with the Grokery and the Grokoins. I was blinded by greed and I didn't think about the consequences of my actions. But I promise, I'm going to make things right. I'll pay back everyone who was affected by the pyramid scheme, and I'll shut down the Grokery for good.

BLUE LOOP: And what about the TrackMania Poop Snacks? Are you going to stop selling those too?

DANIEL: Yes, I'll stop selling the snacks. I never should have made them in the first place. It was a foolish idea and I'm sorry for any harm they may have caused.

HIGH FAN: Well, at least you're doing something right for once.

DANIEL: Please, just give me a chance to make things right. I know I can't undo the damage that's been done, but I want to try and make things better.

BLUE LOOP: Fine, we'll give you a chance. But if you mess up again, we won't be so lenient.

DANIEL: Thank you. I promise, I won't let you down.

The three of them stand in silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Then, without another word, they turn and walk out of the room, leaving behind the remnants of the failed Grokery and the ill-fated TrackMania Poop Snacks.

Daniel Strizhevsky: INT. GRUNION ISLAND - DAY

We see a panoramic shot of Grunion Island, a lush, green paradise.

Suddenly, the sound of a tank engine can be heard.

Cut to:

INT. TANK COCKPIT - DAY

We see TRACKMANIAC, a villainous figure with a maniacal grin, driving the tank towards Grunion Island.

Cut to:

INT. GRUNION ISLAND - DAY

We see GROKE, a muscular superhero with a fierce determination in his eyes, standing atop the highest peak on the island.

He hears the tank approaching and takes a deep breath.

GROKE:

(to himself)

Time to save the green onions.

With a mighty leap, Groke soars through the air and lands on the tank.

FADE TO BLACK.

Samvrutha Tumuluru: to sell baba weights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok some updates on internet bill stuff:

We are in a year contract (ending in May). If we break this contract we have to pay $$

Also apparently after our last year contract expired they started charging us an extra $25 a month for renting the equipment -.-

My bad for not noticing sooner :/

Anyway I called them and they gave me a $50 credit back so it is slightly cheaper I guess though still more than $70.

I asked if we can transfer the account to someone else's name cause I'm not even sure if Dan and I will be using xfinity at our next place and they said yeah you can transfer. 

They offered another discount on WiFi etc but only if we renew until Jan 2024 and I was like nah let me discuss with the roommates cause I think you guys can get something cheaper if it will just be the 2 of you. 

Pls let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Also let me know about baba weights
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess we should call our new apartment and ask if they have xfinity? i think they don't right?

Chris Acker: I'm glad to see that you're having fun and improving your skills in trackmania. 2,423 points is definitely a good effort, and I'm sure you worked hard to earn those points. However, it's important to remember that trackmania is just a game and there are many other things in life to be proud of. Don't worry about comparing your score to others - just keep having fun and keep working on improving your skills!
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's ok to be a little jealous sirs
Chris Acker: I know it can be tough to see someone else with a higher score, but try not to let it get you down. Every player has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to be at different levels. Keep playing and having fun, and you'll get better over time.

Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: When you busargs drive back can you bring the Roomba and the scale?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can do a few back and forth trips together to get the remaining stuff later
Chris Acker: Do we have the hand vacuum there?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah the dumb blue one
Chris Acker: I'll just use that
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Converts into a hand vacuum
Chris Acker: The roomba is going to take too long
Chris Acker: It's going to have to remap the entire apartment because we removed all the furniture that was there when we initially did the mapping
Chris Acker: Not worth
Daniel Strizhevsky: We can just have it go while we're at dinner or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Can it map and clean at the same time?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think we'll need it for the carpets
Daniel Strizhevsky: Because the blue one doesn't work on them
Daniel Strizhevsky: (also then we don't have to do anything, it can just do it while we're eating/doing other stuff)
Chris Acker: It took it like two days to learn the mapping last time‚Ä¶
Chris Acker: Let's make this blue one work
Daniel Strizhevsky: Frick we won't be able to clean the carpets then
Chris Acker: Won't they do vacuuming?  They said they'd have cleaners come right
Chris Acker: The cleaners will certainly vacuum
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'm just worried if it takes them an extra hour or two then Scott will be more likely
