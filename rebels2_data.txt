Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevskywhy does Yuta have a Robinhood feature that I do not
Yuta Baba: Chris doesn’t have this is robinhood doing an ab testing
Yuta Baba: I have had this feature for a while
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol I've had this for well over a year I think
Daniel Strizhevsky: Idk why you don't
Daniel Strizhevsky: Is your app updated
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: What the heck
Chris Acker: I have the latest version but I don’t have that
Chris Acker: Do they give gold members fewer features?
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe you have to opt in somewhere
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or get the beta or something
Daniel Strizhevsky: Idl
Daniel Strizhevsky: Idk
Daniel Strizhevsky: I find it hard to believe they'd ab test this for a year lol
Chris Acker: How is Hawaii
Daniel Strizhevsky: Pretty good so far the airbnb is nice
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: There's a cool hill/mountain in the distance
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: Nice!
Daniel Strizhevsky: We booked a vaccine for tomorrow lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: But were gonna try to see if we can get one today even
Chris Acker: Oh wow
Chris Acker: That would be nice indeed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Indeed
Daniel Strizhevsky: Which vaccine are you getting again
Chris Acker: I don’t have plans yet
Chris Acker: Hopefully not J&J
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: @Daniel Strizhevsky and @Samvrutha Tumuluru question for u
Yuta Baba: Would you add ketchup in your ham sandwich?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Neither of us eat ham sandwiches unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky: I often eat turkey sandwiches, is that similar enough
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or unrelated
Yuta Baba: Yes let’s go with turkey sandwiches
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmm
Chris Acker: Samvrutha is a vegetarian so
Daniel Strizhevsky: I've never tried with ketchup, I feel like it would be kinda weird but would be willing to try it
Chris Acker: She does not get a say unfortunately lol
Yuta Baba: Chris and I had a heated discussion on this yesterday
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: It wasn’t heated
Daniel Strizhevsky: What were the two sides
Yuta Baba: Yes it was
Chris Acker: Because I knew I was correct
Chris Acker: Ketchup does not go on cold cuts
Chris Acker: Of any kind
Chris Acker: It never has
Yuta Baba: Mainly Chris judging me for adding ketchup in sandwiches
Chris Acker: And it likely never will
Yuta Baba: And I looked up a poll on google and only 4 ppl out 54 add ketchup
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: So def minority
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I usually do mustard on mine
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'd like horseradish on it as well
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Mustard is a must for me too
Daniel Strizhevsky: But I don't usually have horseradish on me
Yuta Baba: It was “either ketchup or mayo discussion”
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker Im making sandwiches rn
Yuta Baba: One will have ketchup and the other mayo
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Yuta Baba: Let’s see which one is better
Chris Acker: Kk
Yuta Baba: Ok results are in
Yuta Baba: Mayo is better
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: Welcome
Chris Acker: To being a normal person 😊
Yuta Baba: Can’t believe I was eating sandwiches w ketchup on for more than a year
Chris Acker reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I have never had a ham sandwich but in general I don’t put ketchup on my sandwiches
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I do like the combo of Mayo + hot sauce
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I sometimes eat my pizza with ketchup
Chris Acker: That’s pretty weird as well
Chris Acker: But not as weird as putting it on a cold cut
Yuta Baba reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If the pizza is well sauced it isn’t necessary I feel
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But I like the cold tomato with the hot tomato taste
Yuta Baba: Ok admit I was a weirdo...
Chris Acker: Ye ye
Chris Acker: No worries
Chris Acker: As long as you understand
Chris Acker: Are you gonna live with us????
Yuta Baba: Yeah I’m excited for tmrs lunch
Chris Acker: Have you decided?
Yuta Baba: I get to eat sandwiches w mayo
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Oh lol not yet
Yuta Baba: I’m very tempted
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: alright
Daniel Strizhevsky: it's time to buy some houses
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba ready?
Yuta Baba: Damn @Daniel Strizhevsky lol
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba do you know when you will be able to move in to a new apartment?
Chris Acker: Like in terms of getting off your current lease
Yuta Baba: So I think I’m having that convo with the landlord soon so will see
Yuta Baba: The thing is I don’t have a contract w them this year so I feel kike I can just leave
Yuta Baba: But maybe not I’m not sure
Yuta Baba: As I’m on a visa I don’t want to cause any issues with law
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Will late may be too early for you? Or is that possible
Yuta Baba: What do u mean
Yuta Baba: Oh late May
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: That’s prob too early
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: Idk
Daniel Strizhevsky: i will need an apartment on may 22 :(
Yuta Baba: Can you do Airbnb?
Yuta Baba: My Neighborhood has some openings if u r interested
Yuta Baba: The same landlord and it can be very hot in summer
Yuta Baba: And far from the station
Yuta Baba: But they’ll lower the price for sure
Daniel Strizhevsky: i can do airbnb in theory but then i'd need to decide like today lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause i think there are starting to be very few airbnbs
Daniel Strizhevsky: + expensive
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i'd prefer not to airbnb
Yuta Baba: Yeah makes sense
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker can you move like next month tho
Chris Acker: Yeah I just pay month-to-month so I was planning on moving out in May
Yuta Baba: Okie okie
Chris Acker: Ask your landlord!
Yuta Baba: I’ll need to talk w the landlord
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Ya
Yuta Baba: Do we have an estimate of the place and budget for the house?
Yuta Baba: I know we are still looking but I kinda want to get a sense of what we are aiming at
Daniel Strizhevsky: redwood city, preferably very close to caltrain
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: budget is a good q, i think 3BR apartments go for like 5-6k and homes might be more like 4-5k
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: also 3Ba if possible would add a lot of cost lol
Yuta Baba: Three bedrooms are hard to find tbh
Yuta Baba: https://www.apartments.com/radius-redwood-city-ca/vpq9t8f/
Yuta Baba shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: This looks like a good one
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's also Encore
Daniel Strizhevsky: better rated on google maps lol
Yuta Baba: Yeah that’s the best one I can find in a quick search
Yuta Baba: Yeah I’m shooting for 1.5k max hopefully so it is in my price range
Chris Acker: Oh that might me tough tho lol
Chris Acker: Idk but Dan and samvrutha would be sharing a room so they wouldn’t be paying as much
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah we can discuss price splitting
Chris Acker: I was expecting to pay more like 1700 to be honest
Yuta Baba: Oh
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think it depends how cheap the place would be
Yuta Baba: Tru tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i was thinking it would be somewhere between 25/25/25/25 and 16.6/16.6/33/33 depending on the place
Daniel Strizhevsky: what did we do last time like 19/19/32/36 or something like that?
Daniel Strizhevsky: that doesn't add up lol oops
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba are you sure you didn't mean 1.5m max with that snowflake money ;)
Daniel Strizhevsky: i assume the "k" was a typo :D
Yuta Baba: Oh gosh no I haven’t even sold one share of snowflake stocks lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Daniel Strizhevsky: is it still locked up
Yuta Baba: Nope
Daniel Strizhevsky: :O :O just a long-term believer?
Yuta Baba: I’m not supposed to say that sorry I’m an insider lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok putting all money in snowflake now, ty
Daniel Strizhevsky: jk jk :D
Yuta Baba: I mean compared to December the price is much better to enter now
Yuta Baba: It’s just the public opinion
Daniel Strizhevsky: true true
Daniel Strizhevsky: didn't @Chris Acker buy a lot at the top lol
Yuta Baba: I’m sure he’s on red rn
Yuta Baba: Cuz it ranked by like 45% or so lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: anyway back to housing
Yuta Baba: Wait for the lockup period to be over before buying any IPO stocks
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Ya
Daniel Strizhevsky: if we can find something in the <=5k range, i think that woudl fit your budget
Yuta Baba: That would be personally great if u guys are ok with it
Daniel Strizhevsky: is it a hard 1.5k or more like ~1.5k lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause it may be really hard to find a 3br under 5k
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm all for spending less lol but the chances are slim
Yuta Baba: Around 1.5k
Daniel Strizhevsky: also does that include utilities or just rent
Yuta Baba: But I don’t see the point of paying more than 1.7k
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Just the rent
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Yuta Baba: But including the utilities would be great as well
Daniel Strizhevsky: now if you and chris want to share a room ;) we can get it down to <1k/person :D
Yuta Baba: Sorry sorry my budget is p right now appreciate ur understanding
Yuta Baba: Oh no offense but pls no
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: no problem lol
Yuta Baba: We are not at college anymore
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok let me do a bit of digging around but
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: actually there might be a 2br with loft too i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: if you want to have a loft to save money
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol we'll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: 3Brs are unfortunately pretty expensive so we'll see whether it'll work with your budget
Daniel Strizhevsky: but we can try
Yuta Baba: Yeah thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I mean worst comes to worst I can handle it but I don’t want to set the bar high from the beginning
Daniel Strizhevsky: right
Yuta Baba: One another thing I wanted to discuss is if I can’t move in late May or early June what can we do?
Yuta Baba: Bc I don’t want my current housemates to cover the fee
Yuta Baba: Still need to have a conversation with the landlord but any ideas?
Daniel Strizhevsky: then I'd just get an airbnb, but i'm not sure if there are any available anymore lol so let me see
Daniel Strizhevsky: but in that case i'd want confirmation like today or tomorrow
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause i'd have to act fast
Samvrutha Tumuluru: My only requests are <= 0.5 miles from caltrain closer the better. And I would generally like a place that is very sunny. Seems like I may be forced to WFH 2 days a week so I need sunlight
Yuta Baba: Right makes sense
Daniel Strizhevsky: btw yuta would you consider a 2br + loft to save cost?
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's significantly cheaper?
Daniel Strizhevsky: (like what chris had last year)
Daniel Strizhevsky: that's an option here: https://www.201marshall.com/floorplans.aspx
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: (this place is also 6 weeks free and 100 feet from caltrain)
Daniel Strizhevsky: so it is likely really really cheap
Daniel Strizhevsky: also also one note
Daniel Strizhevsky: if you're trying to decide between late may or later, even outside of my own bias
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I personally like lofted apartments cause the living room is very sunny and friendly
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But you would have to be ok with having a makeshift wall
Daniel Strizhevsky: prices are going up (theyve gone up $100/month since i looked a few days ago) and i think they will continue to do so until august
Daniel Strizhevsky: so a place in july or august will probably cost a lot more
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We try to be respectful of the lofted persons bedtime though
Yuta Baba: Let’s do 3 br lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: Yeah I wouldn’t do lofted again
Daniel Strizhevsky: what if it was like 1.1k ;)
Daniel Strizhevsky: or 1k
Chris Acker: Wouldn’t do
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Chris Acker: I make money for a reason lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Yeah let’s not do it then
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok then to be honest
Daniel Strizhevsky: our options are like
Daniel Strizhevsky: either Encore/Radius
Daniel Strizhevsky: or hope to find something decent on craiglist
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think that's it
Daniel Strizhevsky: but @Yuta Baba and @Chris Acker would need to also confirm about sharing a bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause we won't be able to find a 3br/3ba
Samvrutha Tumuluru: ^This is true
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I wouldd prefer encore over radius
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/redwood-city/558-james-ave-redwood-city-ca-94062--2220480200

this is actually quite a good option
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/redwood-city/508-chestnut-st-redwood-city-ca-94063--1150912458

and this is an alright (but cheap) option too
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Chris Acker: I’m okay with bathroom sharing
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Baba when do you think you'll have the talk with your landlord?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: 2nd one is a little further than I would prefer
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also kitchen in second one sucks no space at all for prep
Daniel Strizhevsky: i wonder if encore has like a month off deal or something like that, they said call to ask for specials
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If they have a deal then that would be great then it meets all requirements
Yuta Baba: Ya I’d be fine sharing a bathroom
Chris Acker: Also because samvrutha would not be joining immediately we'd have to share the price of the house between the 3 of us at first
Yuta Baba: Let me tak with the landlord but not sure when he’s gon get back
Chris Acker: for one or two months depending on when samvrutha comes
Chris Acker: assuming we move in may
Yuta Baba: That’s fine
Yuta Baba: Also ill be gone for like 2 months this year
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I'm targeting coming back beginning of August
Yuta Baba: I’ll be flying back to jpn and stay w my parents for 2 months
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So you can assume I will pay august rent
Yuta Baba: But I’ll pay the rent don’t worry
Yuta Baba: But just a FYI
Daniel Strizhevsky: can i come
Daniel Strizhevsky: for like 1 month maybe
Daniel Strizhevsky: :)
Yuta Baba: I’d u want to yes
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Not sure if I can let u stay at my parents house tho
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: My mom has been a little ill
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: I hope she feels better!
Yuta Baba: And not sure if we can host u for a long period
Yuta Baba: Yeah thank u
Daniel Strizhevsky: i will stay in a love hotel
Chris Acker reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: I’m flying back to see her
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Samvrutha Tumuluru: No not allowed
Yuta Baba: But u can stay for like a week for sure!!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The love hotel not you flying to see your family of course
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: dan, you and me in a love hotel in japan
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👎
Chris Acker: let's do it
Daniel Strizhevsky: im down
Yuta Baba: Can I join too
Chris Acker: no u need to be with your mom
Chris Acker: sorry
Yuta Baba: Wow
Yuta Baba: I’m offended
Yuta Baba: It’s ok I’ll stay in a different room
Chris Acker: fine u can stay a few nights
Yuta Baba: Yayyyyyyyy
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you think this will be like days? or weeks
Yuta Baba: Hopefully days
Yuta Baba: But who knows
Daniel Strizhevsky: what's the worst case?
Yuta Baba: I’d I don’t hear back for two days I’ll reach out to a different person
Daniel Strizhevsky: like if he says no, when can you move?
Yuta Baba: There are multiple options
1. Best case: I can move out anytime and no additional cost to my housemates which is highly unlikely
2. They allow me to sublet my current room
3. Worst case: contract is a contract and I have to pay until August.
Yuta Baba: Well worst comes to worst I’ll pay to both my current rent and the new rent which is like a lot but I’ll suck it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: nah that would suck lol let's not do that
Daniel Strizhevsky: hmm
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it was option 2, do you think you'd be able to do that by late may/early june?
Yuta Baba: That’s my hope if I can find someone
Daniel Strizhevsky: or do you think that would take a while
Yuta Baba: Idk
Yuta Baba: But if I have to pay two rents for just a month that’s not the worst thing
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's for a couple weeks tbh i'd rather just pitch in for part of your rent than get an airbnb
Daniel Strizhevsky: because the airbnb I would've booked is already gone lol and i think any reasonable one would cost 2.3k+ for me
Yuta Baba: That’s totally fair and I really appreciate that
Yuta Baba: Let me shoot an email to the landlord and if I don’t here back for like a couple of days I will reach out to a different person
Chris Acker: yeah i can pitch in as well in that worst case
Yuta Baba: Will keep u posted
Daniel Strizhevsky: also - what part of august? would it be aug 1 or late august
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it ends up option 3
Yuta Baba: Late August
Yuta Baba: But hey I don’t think that will happen
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah hopefully not
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok for decision making let's do this:
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 3 i think that just won't work out tbh because then samvrutha wouldn't have a place by the time she comes back and that would be too many moving parts
Chris Acker: hmm dan and i could also airbnb the room out or something for a few months...
Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 1 OR option 2, i think we can work out something that starts late may and just mess around with pricing for a couple weeks if needed
Yuta Baba: Can you give me this week to sort it out?
Daniel Strizhevsky: or this yeah, but is most likely not legal, or very difficult to set up
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess just from my end, i think i'm going to commit to NOT getting a temporary airbnb
Daniel Strizhevsky: and we'll search for both 3br and 2br for now just to be safe
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then hopefully book something once you decide
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not option 2 whatever in worst case if needed I too can pitch in
Yuta Baba: Yeah sounds good to me and thank u all
Chris Acker: yeah i agree, if it's option 3 i don't think this will work and we'll have to DROP yuta
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeet
Chris Acker: let's hope for 1 or 2! lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Yeah I agree
Yuta Baba: With what Chris said
Samvrutha Tumuluru: wow that's the firstt prooper usage of yeet in a long time
Yuta Baba: Or I suck it up and pay both rents
Yuta Baba: Well see
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yuta will indeed get yeeted
Yuta Baba: I’d u give me alocohol I would be down tbh lol
Yuta Baba: Jk
Yuta Baba: I’m not alcoholic just to be clear lol
Chris Acker: lol alcohol would be on me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Noted if we give him drinks we can throw him out of whatever upper story window we want
Yuta Baba: LOL
Chris Acker: i guess you could do that, but I would feel bad lol
Chris Acker: especially after you capped rent at 1500 lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also IMO if encore has 1 month off, i'm basically down to just ge tit
Daniel Strizhevsky: because that would be a reasonable price and pretty nice place
Daniel Strizhevsky: only downside is 0.5 miles from caltrain and it's on a huge road
Samvrutha Tumuluru: inappropriate. Please wash out your mouth
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true walk to train station is not ideal
Samvrutha Tumuluru: but hopefully distance means it will not be loud af during the week
Chris Acker: .5 miles = exercise = weight loss
Daniel Strizhevsky: do british websites use biscuits?
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: is that a dad joke
Daniel Strizhevsky: yes
Chris Acker: i like it, thank you
Daniel Strizhevsky: you are welcome
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is true. Though I could get my weightloss from CHLOETING which only takes 10 mins of HIGH INTENSITY interval training instead
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But I see your point
Yuta Baba: Okay great news
Yuta Baba: Turned out I’m on a monthly contract so I can leave at the end of May
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: I’m negotiating the option 1 but will see
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Ok I need to find someone to take my room
Yuta Baba: If u all know anyone or spread the words that would be much appreciated!
Yuta Baba: Will send u more information later
Yuta Baba: Bout my house
Chris Acker: Put it up on Facebook!
Chris Acker: That’s how we do it at my house
Chris Acker: Have done it many times
Yuta Baba: Yeah I have some fb groups but do u know any groups that are good
Chris Acker: I’ll send you some
Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u
Yuta Baba: I am really hoping I don’t have to cover my current rent until August
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait so first they said you can leave in end of may but then they said you need to find someone? lol
Yuta Baba: I can leave in May but I have a verbal agreement with my housemates until August
Daniel Strizhevsky: ah ok
Yuta Baba: Cuz the price for the whole house won’t change
Daniel Strizhevsky: got it
Daniel Strizhevsky: we should call Encore today btw and ask if they have any 1-month discounts or anything
Daniel Strizhevsky: i can do it after 4pm
Daniel Strizhevsky: unless anyone can earlier
Chris Acker: Please go ahead and do that Daniel
Yuta Baba: Which one is encore can u send me the link again
Chris Acker: I sent you the link in our private chat I think
Chris Acker: To the excel sheet
Chris Acker: Which has the link to encore
Yuta Baba: Ah
Yuta Baba: Smart
Yuta Baba: The spreadsheet says no availability tho
Yuta Baba: Is it available now?
Daniel Strizhevsky: https://www.encoreredwoodcity.com/floor-plans/
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's on available now, we'd probably have to find the next available one since it's too early
Chris Acker: Apartments in California are taken within like a week of coming on the market
Chris Acker: Sometimes faster
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: Oh ok
Yuta Baba: Yeah I’d be down for encore
Daniel Strizhevsky: actually, might be tough
Daniel Strizhevsky: it says there's one other place
Daniel Strizhevsky: and it's available 6/07
Daniel Strizhevsky: so if that means everything else that pops up will be after 6/07
Daniel Strizhevsky: taht would suck
Daniel Strizhevsky: we'll need to keep a close eye
Yuta Baba: I mean I don’t mind paying for May if necessary
Yuta Baba: If everyone like encore
Yuta Baba: Likes*
Chris Acker: Should we just pay for may to lock it in?
Yuta Baba: Ya
Chris Acker: Thoughts @Daniel Strizhevsky?
Yuta Baba: Or I can stay at my house for another month and pay a lower rent
Yuta Baba: Up to u
Daniel Strizhevsky: let's call and ask first
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: about specials + any estimates on availability
Chris Acker: Yeah definitely call first
Daniel Strizhevsky: tbh if there's stuff in early june i'd probably rather just get an airbnb for 2 weeks
Daniel Strizhevsky: but yeah let's see
Yuta Baba: Well that’s actually important cuz that’s gon decide what to write in housing groups
Yuta Baba: So let’s call today and gather information and make moves
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok
Daniel Strizhevsky: and will one of you be able to visit and see if the location is ok? that's my main worry
Daniel Strizhevsky: since it's on a large street and like 0.5 miles from downtown
Daniel Strizhevsky: i think our san mateo place was decent but closer to downtown is better, and this place is a bit further
Daniel Strizhevsky: (only a minute or two)
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'd definitely want someone to see it in person before we commit
Chris Acker: Yeah do they have open tours
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah i think so
Chris Acker: And do they operate on weekends
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll ask when i call
Yuta Baba sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah saturday 9-6 i believe
Yuta Baba: I can also go to the neighborhood and check
Yuta Baba: It will be a long walk but ok
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: 🚴
Yuta Baba: My bike has flat tires
Yuta Baba: Or just lack of air
Yuta Baba: And I don’t have a pump
Yuta Baba: We can schedule one to go too @Chris Acker
Yuta Baba: But not this weekend
Yuta Baba: I’m hella busy
Yuta Baba: And prob not next Saturday it’s 5/1 and we have a reporting duty lol
Chris Acker: Okay it looks like I will be visiting lol
Yuta Baba: I mean the tour tho
Yuta Baba: I can take a walk to there
Chris Acker: I don’t think we can wait that long before decking
Chris Acker: Deciding
Yuta Baba: If the tour is like 30 min I guess I can do tmr
Yuta Baba: But not 5/1
Yuta Baba: It’s the end of quarter stuff...
Daniel Strizhevsky: btw we don't need to discuss the full details of pricing right now, but last time we split rent 21/21/27/31 with 4 people in the 2br+loft (and i think we split utilities 25/25/25/25?) - it would depend on how nice everyone's rooms and stuff are this time around, but are we all comfortable with something fairly similar?
Daniel Strizhevsky: e.g. if samvrutha+my room is like huge and has 2 bathrooms and closets or something we'd pay more than that, if it's like really tiny or something it woudl be less
Daniel Strizhevsky: but in that general range
Daniel Strizhevsky: and of course depends on how your two rooms cmopare
Yuta Baba: Yeah I think it makes sense
Yuta Baba: Encore is about 5k I’m all good!
Yuta Baba: Prob it’ll something be like 20/20/30/30 idk but will see
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah assuming you pay like 28-29%, that would exactly meet you 1.5k budget lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: and if we get a 1 month off, that'll be really nice
Yuta Baba: Tru tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm really hoping for that 1 month off
Daniel Strizhevsky: since most places are doing it
Yuta Baba: Me too
Yuta Baba: We can negotiate maybe?
Daniel Strizhevsky: i hope so, but unlikely with these big complexes
Yuta Baba reacted with 😢
Chris Acker: Yeah probably not unfortunately
Chris Acker: Idk, with Covid they might be more desperate but
Daniel Strizhevsky: true
Yuta Baba: We’ll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: also good-ish news, you can rent up to 2 weeks in advance, so worst case we could rent for may 7th
Yuta Baba: Maybe find a close place where they have one month off and use that as a negotiation icee
Daniel Strizhevsky: not like april 23rd lol
Yuta Baba: Goooood
Daniel Strizhevsky: also one more option lol
Chris Acker reacted with 😮
Daniel Strizhevsky: is if we get one more friend and get adjacent 2BRs in 201 Marshall or Huxley
Chris Acker: What are the chances we can get adjacent units lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess it doesn't have to be adjacent adjacent
Daniel Strizhevsky: just nearby
Daniel Strizhevsky: just something to think about
Daniel Strizhevsky: in case we visit and see this place is way too far from downtown
Daniel Strizhevsky: or they don't have 1mo off
Daniel Strizhevsky: any questions for me to ask encore?
Daniel Strizhevsky: apart from what i'm already gonna ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: they didnt pick up i left a voicemail
Yuta Baba: When we can move in
Chris Acker: Parking fees?
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Prob parking for Chris
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Yuta Baba: Yeah I was gon say that
Chris Acker: Daniel and samvrutha have a car as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Oh is that just me
Yuta Baba: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: so 2 parking spots
Daniel Strizhevsky: right?
Chris Acker: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: unless yuta you plan on carring it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll ask how much utilities usually cost too
Yuta Baba: Well since u guys have a car I won’t prob need one
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh i thought on our yosemite/tahoe trips we'd go in 4 separate cars
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba it will be hard to move to SF once you have a car because parking is no less than $400 per month in the city
Daniel Strizhevsky: for more Freedom
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: 🦅
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Tru
Daniel Strizhevsky: tbh maybe 8 cars
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'd prefer to drive a different car there than back
Daniel Strizhevsky: downhill roads are to be enjoyed differently from uphill roads
Chris Acker: Oh wow that is excessive
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I already own 16 cars im happy to share one of 8 of my medium favorite cars with @Yuta Baba
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: I only buy a new car when I run out of gas
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Let me know when u run out Gad cuz I can buy ur old car and wash it very hard
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok so
Daniel Strizhevsky: no good news unfortunately
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe semi-good news
Daniel Strizhevsky: there's no 1 month off
Daniel Strizhevsky: they can either give us $1000 off if we move in within 2 weeks, or they can actually give us a May 22nd move in date (but no $1k off)
Daniel Strizhevsky: parking unfortunately is tandem spot only (what we had at metropolitan with freddie), and is $150/mo
Daniel Strizhevsky: there are 10 3BRs and he doesn't know if any new ones will show up
Daniel Strizhevsky: he also mentioned that this one has been on the market for a month though lol
Chris Acker: Wtf lol
Chris Acker: Why isn’t it being taken
Chris Acker: Tandem is kind of sucky but whatever
Daniel Strizhevsky: tandem is quite bad lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you plan on driving or caltraining to work?
Daniel Strizhevsky: cause if you're driving tandem will be kind of a dealbreaker
Daniel Strizhevsky: he also said there's street parking and it's hit or miss
Chris Acker: I would be driving
Chris Acker: I wouldn’t say thats a dealbreaker tho
Chris Acker: We can plan the morning
Chris Acker: I’m sure one of us will always leave before the other
Chris Acker: Or we can just leave at the same time like good friends
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would not say deal breaker
Daniel Strizhevsky: what time do you plan on leaving work usually?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think depends on who is leaving first
Daniel Strizhevsky: leaving for work*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You just park in order
Daniel Strizhevsky: also depends who comes home first
Yuta Baba: Wait dan r u driving to work
Yuta Baba: Thought ur taking cal train
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'm not 100% sure yet
Daniel Strizhevsky: the tandem spot it also a stack
Daniel Strizhevsky: so someone would have to leave first and come back last
Daniel Strizhevsky: and the other leave last and come back first
Chris Acker: What if we have each other an extra key and we can always move the other persons car lol
Chris Acker: Give*
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I would say the parking spot being a deal breaker is a bit much
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If we had a lot more options then sure
Yuta Baba: That’s kinda annoying
Daniel Strizhevsky: fine i'll say not dealbreaker but it's a major inconvenience i'd say
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But due to all our restrictions it’s the smallest concession
Yuta Baba: I’m not gon saying on this as I don’t have a car
Daniel Strizhevsky: if we have to switch every single day
Yuta Baba: And sounds like I shouldn’t buy a car for this year
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: So u guys get to take me anywhere that would be fun
Daniel Strizhevsky: i wouldn't underestimate how annoying it is to switch cars 1-2x a day
Daniel Strizhevsky: 1x is all but guaranteed
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i won't say dealbreaker but i think it's quite inconvenient lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: also for comparison metropolitan was $80 for tandem spot
Daniel Strizhevsky: this would be the only option i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: but yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They said there is street parking as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Though it is “hit or miss”
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh yeah also we're responsible for all utilities - they estimated $175/mo for water + sewage + trash
Chris Acker: Maybe the situation will be elucidated a bit more when I go in person
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then the rest is electricity
Chris Acker: That’s reasonable
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: also
Daniel Strizhevsky: they said CURRENTLY no spots available but there's a waitlist
Daniel Strizhevsky: let me forward this email
Chris Acker: I will let you
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Yuta Babawhat's your email?
Chris Acker: bana.yuta@gmail.com
Chris Acker: Baba*
Daniel Strizhevsky: classic bana
Samvrutha Tumuluru: @Chris Acker when you go check it out can you scope out the street parking situation and see if the street is actually completely full or if it seems like a good option
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Let me know when u r going I might be able to tag along
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: also
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see 2 options for encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think I’m getting high ogg the fumes lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: a) just book for may 22
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Wrong chat
Daniel Strizhevsky: sorry
Daniel Strizhevsky: was dealing with some fumes
Daniel Strizhevsky: b)
Daniel Strizhevsky: risk it and wait a week or two before booking
Daniel Strizhevsky: and then we get both the $1000 and a late may move in date
Daniel Strizhevsky: because it says look&lease is only valid for 24 hrs after tour
Yuta Baba: Can you check how big the closet is
Yuta Baba: I need to think if I need to bring y drawer
Yuta Baba: Which would be pain
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Oh yeah do they say room square ft anywhere
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I didn’t se it on website
Chris Acker: I think this is the least of our worries lol
Yuta Baba: 1436ft
Daniel Strizhevsky: 14XX sq ft
Daniel Strizhevsky: which worry
Yuta Baba: And I have no idea how big that is
Chris Acker: Closet space
Daniel Strizhevsky: i feel like a lesser worry is the color of the fridge
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i get what you're getting at
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If the fridge is white I’m out
Yuta Baba: Tru tru just listing up all the questions I have
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be living on my own
Samvrutha Tumuluru: In a different city
Chris Acker: In a dumpster
Yuta Baba: We can paint it
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: this is the Engineering Mindset
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it isn’t stainless steel then I will throw it out
Yuta Baba: Oh u can take the parking spot
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And set the apartment on fire
Yuta Baba: Yo i work in the tech industry lol
Yuta Baba: I do everything to make it work ok
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: You can build ur own fridge in ur room
Yuta Baba: Can’t change the material sorry
Chris Acker: You can turn the fridge into extra closet space
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok so
Daniel Strizhevsky: let's make a yung decision
Yuta Baba: And keep it clean and fresh
Yuta Baba: And little chilly
Yuta Baba: Great for summer
Daniel Strizhevsky: do we risk it or tour tomorrow?
Daniel Strizhevsky: we need to respond to Yung Man
Chris Acker: Is it a risk
Yuta Baba: Did u ask how many ppl are interested
Yuta Baba: Or just us
Daniel Strizhevsky: no i didn't ask
Yuta Baba: Damniiiit
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk if they'd answer that honestly lol
Yuta Baba: It’s ok not ur fault
Yuta Baba: Tru
Chris Acker: Even if I tour tomorrow, would they be able to connect that to an application later that you submit?
Chris Acker: I guess it would have my name on it but, I wonder how hard they are tracking
Daniel Strizhevsky: well
Daniel Strizhevsky: the risk is also about other people taking it
Daniel Strizhevsky: not just the 24 hour thing
Yuta Baba: Which can happen
Chris Acker: Yeah but I mean we can tour tomorrow anyway
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah
Yuta Baba: Ok I actually will tag along if I feel ok tmr
Daniel Strizhevsky: he told me to respond to his email to schedule the thing
Yuta Baba: I just got vaccinated
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: maybe you can just respond to schedule
Chris Acker: Okay
Yuta Baba: Let me know when ur going
Daniel Strizhevsky: closets seem big btw
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: walk-in closet
Daniel Strizhevsky: from tje floorplan
Yuta Baba: Maybe I don’t have to bring my drawer then
Daniel Strizhevsky: diijjoijoijioijojoijoijoijoijoijoioijoijoijoijoijoijoijoij

Daniel Strizhevsky: also throwing https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/508-Chestnut-St-Redwood-City-CA-94063/15565936_zpid/? out there one more time
Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Yuta Baba: Not bad
Yuta Baba: Looks a bit far from the station tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah it's 0.1 miles further, but it doesn't have a large street to cross
Daniel Strizhevsky: so it may even out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Kitchen bad, distance far, and only 1000 sqft which is small for 4 people
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Indigo apartments are nice but too expensive 😭😭
Chris Acker: How much is indigo again
Daniel Strizhevsky: 6.8k + 1 month off lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: so still like 6.2k
Daniel Strizhevsky: we can call and ask if it's negotiable cause nobody is gonna rent a 6.8k 3br lol
Chris Acker: Holy freakin moly
Chris Acker: If you guys pay 1450, Yuta pays 1500 and I pay 1800 then it could work lol
Yuta Baba: Why would I only pay 1500 that’s not fair
Yuta Baba: I mean I would be happy about it but I don’t think that’s fair?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol indigo is probably not worth if it’s that expensive
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have mixed reviews on Google
Chris Acker: Wait so if they are not doing in person tours would I just be going over there to look at the outside?
Chris Acker: Of we are doing a virtual tour can’t we all do it together?
Chris Acker: If*
Yuta Baba: If virtual yes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They aren’t doing in person!
Samvrutha Tumuluru: *?
Yuta Baba: Rona
Yuta Baba: Makes sense
Chris Acker: Oh in the email it says you can do a set guided tour
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: Let me look on their website if I need to set that up or I can just go..
Chris Acker: Well I think I should just be able to go..
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba do you want to go check it out today?
Yuta Baba: Yeah I can spare an hour or two
Chris Acker: Okay I’ve got to shower and stuff but I can probably pick you up in an hour or so
Yuta Baba: Do we need to reserve the tour
Chris Acker: I don’t think so?
Yuta Baba: Or can we just show up
Yuta Baba: Can u check before we go
Chris Acker: I’ll call them
Yuta Baba: Okie thx thx
Chris Acker: They are not picking up the phone
Yuta Baba: Yikes
Yuta Baba: We can just go and knock
Yuta Baba: I’d they don’t let us in we can still check the parking and outside
Chris Acker: We can get a resident to show us their apartment
Chris Acker: Or we can break in

Daniel Strizhevsky: How was it
Yuta Baba: we liked it
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: chris is gon send u the videos we took
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: each room is a bit small but not too small and i think we can make it work
Yuta Baba: not sure about where you would work tho the master bed room cannot handle one bed and two deks
Yuta Baba: desks
Yuta Baba: so one of u has to work in the living room which is p spacious
Daniel Strizhevsky: I'll probably be in the office all the time so it's probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: How do the rooms compare to metropolitan
Daniel Strizhevsky: And how's the lighting!?!
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess I'll wait to see the video lol
Yuta Baba: not sure about the individual room but the living room in san mateo is def bigger
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Yuta Baba: but encore is p spacious for four of us too
Yuta Baba: we have a lot of windows no no light needed during the day
Yuta Baba: the entrance light is yellowish but we didnt try the other lighting sadly
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yee I meant natural lighting, that's good
Daniel Strizhevsky: Oh interesting lol I thought that place was 1200sf
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe not
Yuta Baba sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: The ones outside is the roof top
Yuta Baba: We have the common room and rooftop and garden with the grill for the residents
Yuta Baba: Plus the gym
Daniel Strizhevsky: I see
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks pretty good, maybe not quite the metropolitan lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: And oof 10x10 is a small master lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you sure it wouldn't fit 2 desks?
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess depends on layout
Yuta Baba: Depends on the desk size and how u want to lay out the room yes
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I forgot even if I don't wfh I still need a desk
Daniel Strizhevsky: To GAME and study and such lol
Chris Acker: I sent a video of it to samvrutha
Chris Acker: Messenger wouldn’t let me send it because the file is too large...
Yuta Baba: Lol
Chris Acker: And I couldn’t send it to Dan because he is android (bleh)
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: But I think it went through to Samvrutha
Chris Acker shared a video.
Chris Acker: Here are some shorter videos to tide you over
Chris Acker shared a video.
Yuta Baba: @Chris Ackerwhats the housing group you used before?
Yuta Baba: trying to post it
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Not sure if Redwood City counts as “south bay”..
Chris Acker: But the Bay Area one would work for you
Yuta Baba: Ya
Yuta Baba: Thx
Chris Acker: There is also a group called Redwood City Shop and trade so you might want to put it there too
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you guys think that island would fit 4 people on one side?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Like our previous bar
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or will we need a separate table
Chris Acker: I think it will fit 4 people
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks to me like a slightly worse metropolitan overall, is that the vibe you guys got
Chris Acker: No I felt like it was a slightly better metropolitan
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: The building was built in 2019
Chris Acker: So everything felt very new and in good order
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I guess the finish is nicer, but everything is quite a bit smaller isn't it
Chris Acker: At metropolitan everything felt like it was falling apart lol
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sad that the rooms are so small I think bedroom size is the main downside
Chris Acker: I think the bedrooms other than master are a comparable size
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess our bedroom last time was quite small too
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think this master is smaller?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Like idk who designed the buildings but by making the closets slightly smaller and removing that book they could have gotten a lot of space
Chris Acker: @Yuta Baba what are the master bedroom dimensions again?
Chris Acker: It’s on that sheet
Chris Acker: I could also find it online I guess
Daniel Strizhevsky: He sent a pic
Chris Acker: It actually doesn’t say on the website lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's like 10.5*10.5
Chris Acker: Oh o see
Daniel Strizhevsky: I think metropolitan was 10.5*12.5
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: Rip
Daniel Strizhevsky: I mean it's probably doable
Daniel Strizhevsky: Why is the master smaller though lol is that common
Daniel Strizhevsky: That seems weird
Chris Acker: You lose 2 ft on one side
Daniel Strizhevsky: Hmm
Yuta Baba: one alternative is dan and samvrutha takes one of the non master and use the bathroom for the non master
Yuta Baba: and chris and i will use the master bathroom
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Resending right side up
Daniel Strizhevsky: Lol
Chris Acker: Yeah it’s just a bit awkward that one would have to go into the other persons room lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: You have to go into the master br to use it right
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah only problem with that is like you have to go through the persons room
Yuta Baba: mY bAd
Yuta Baba: it depends on when they take a shower
Yuta Baba: i dont know just throwing out an idea
Daniel Strizhevsky: Where it says "linen" on the floorplan that's just the nook right?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Another idea is one desk in master
Daniel Strizhevsky: No closet?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And one desk in that random nook
Chris Acker: Yes
Yuta Baba: there is a bigger closet in the master
Daniel Strizhevsky: I can't see how this place is more sq ft than metropolitan lol
Yuta Baba: did metropolitan consider the rooftop to be part of that sq feet
Chris Acker: Metropolitan also didn’t have any hallway
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: i feel like it might not
Yuta Baba: yeah hall way is quite long actually
Yuta Baba: unnecessarily
Yuta Baba: and that nook for no reason
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah I think balconies usually aren't counted
Daniel Strizhevsky: Maybe the balcony here is?
Yuta Baba: idk
Chris Acker: I mean square footage is not an issue besides the master bedroom
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think living room has enough space?
Yuta Baba: i second taht
Daniel Strizhevsky: For like couch + tv
Chris Acker: Yes
Daniel Strizhevsky: And a table?
Daniel Strizhevsky: And stuff
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok cool
Yuta Baba: the living room is spatious
Chris Acker: I think we could even get a desk in the living room perhaps
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: So you could maybe fit one in the master bedroom and another out there
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think yeah living room space is probably fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: Ok so how about non interior stuff
Daniel Strizhevsky: Thoughts on location? How's the big road
Yuta Baba: there is a storage
Yuta Baba: all shared
Yuta Baba: and each closet is huge
Yuta Baba: you can even put your desk in the storage
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: You can hear traffic from the apartment but not worse than metropolitan I think
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: no natual lighting tho but it is huge
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: Location is pretty good.  It might get a bit annoying crossing the big road, but J walking might be a possibility as well :)
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: and it has some nice view that redwood has to offer
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😋
Chris Acker: Yeah the view is pretty good for Redwood City
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Is this our only option what was the other apartment complex?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Overall has the tour made you strongly pro encore
Chris Acker: I don’t think we have another
Yuta Baba: yeah this room is a corner room closest to the big street
Yuta Baba: yeah i think we liked encore
Chris Acker: Besides the expensive one
Yuta Baba: but i think the issue comes down to the master bedroom
Chris Acker: We have some houses that we could consider
Yuta Baba: prob worth mentioning that we have 1000 bucks coupon that that expires today right?
Yuta Baba: so if we want to move in we should prob decide today
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think the other place was radius
Yuta Baba: radius is p close from encore actually
Yuta Baba: we have two 3BD and 2 Bathrooms there
Yuta Baba: i mean chris we can try tomorrow if we want to check it out
Yuta Baba: the sq feet is smaller at radius tho
Daniel Strizhevsky: Btw
Daniel Strizhevsky: If we're willing to pay 5260
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I wish they would put dimensions on these floor plans
Daniel Strizhevsky: We should consider this too, 3 baths even
Chris Acker: They are probably closed on Sunday right

Daniel Strizhevsky shared a link.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sqr fr could be smaller but if it is better allocated might not matter
Daniel Strizhevsky: And the house is likely negotiable
Yuta Baba: no sunday is open
Yuta Baba: https://www.essexapartmenthomes.com/apartments/redwood-city/radius/floor-plans-and-pricing
Yuta Baba shared a link.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Are you guys still in rwc?
Chris Acker: Nope
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: that house looks nice but is a bit pricyyy
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah but since it's a house we can negotiate
Daniel Strizhevsky: So we can probably make it <= encore price
Chris Acker: Hmm I don’t know about that
Chris Acker: Also it doesn’t look like that house has A/C
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: It says “cooling features: none”
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: It was built in 1922 lol
Chris Acker: I’m kind of scared of houses because they are old and things break and it’s a pain
Chris Acker: Never underestimate the value of new things
Chris Acker: The internet connection might also be questionable
Yuta Baba: I feel like we should visit radius tmr?
Yuta Baba: it doesnt say the price but we can call before we go
Yuta Baba: and we can book an appointment online
Chris Acker: Sure
Chris Acker: Do you know if we have to set up a meeting
Chris Acker: Can you book an appointment for tomorrow morning?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Fair enough
Daniel Strizhevsky: It might not have availability, yeah you should ask
Daniel Strizhevsky: Also irrelevant but
Yuta Baba: Yeah we can book online
Daniel Strizhevsky: Metropolitan 3Br is 4.8k and 2 months off 🤦
Yuta Baba: I mean o would be down for metropolitan tbh
Chris Acker: I would not lol
Chris Acker: Too far
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Daniel Strizhevsky: Same but it's far for Chris and samvrutha lol
Chris Acker: From work
Yuta Baba: Fair
Yuta Baba: Yeah redwood apartments don’t have 3 bedrooms
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think we should check out radius if the building seems poorly maintained or something then yeah lets just go with encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan and I will be able to figure out something with the desks
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker r u down to go tmr
Samvrutha Tumuluru: As long as you bois don't mind the possibility of one of our desks maybe needing to go in the living room maybe
Yuta Baba: If you are ok w that table being the table for beer pong yes :)
Yuta Baba: Or like Chris said you can set the desk in some space in the hallway
Chris Acker: Yeah I can go to radius
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: Let’s book it tonight when do u wanna go
Chris Acker: Should we try to make an appointment or just go?
Chris Acker: Is it automated?
Yuta Baba: We should make an appointment
Yuta Baba: Idk
Chris Acker: Let’s go early on the morning
Yuta Baba: We can do it online
Yuta Baba: Agreed
Yuta Baba: ok the earliest is 11am
Chris Acker: Where do you see that?
Chris Acker: Nevermind i see it
Chris Acker: Can you book it?
Yuta Baba: Ya
Yuta Baba: Okay I booked it at 11am
Yuta Baba: It says the tour length is 30 min
Yuta Baba: So we gotta be a bit quick
Yuta Baba: Idk
Yuta Baba: Do u wanna pick me up at 1040 tmr morning
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The recent reviews for radius are kinda scary
Samvrutha Tumuluru: mainly lots of packages being stolen
Samvrutha Tumuluru: one person said there were homeless people sleeping in the stairwell?
Yuta Baba: What the hell
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Can you pls check the mailroom/ stairwell if possible during your visit
Yuta Baba: Yes
Yuta Baba: We can also ask about the security as well
Yuta Baba: Encore is p safe cuz you can’t use the elevator if u don’t have the key
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a photo.
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This is the second review I've seen talking about homeless people in the stairwell
Samvrutha Tumuluru: my hopes for radius are low
Yuta Baba: Would u be ok living in encore?
Yuta Baba: I mean we can still check out radius
Yuta Baba: It’s 8 months ago it might be different now
Samvrutha Tumuluru: there was one from 1 month ago as well
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If it isn't a huge inconvenience I think we should still check it out
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But like almost every review mentions packages being stolen
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And mail being left out in the lobby
Samvrutha Tumuluru: like letters from the dmv irs etc
Yuta Baba: Hmmmm not good
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And the property management being bad and unresponsive
Yuta Baba: I mean if that’s the constant review and we might want to pass it
Yuta Baba: We can still check it out tho
Yuta Baba: If Chris is down
Yuta Baba: It’s basically him driving so lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Let me see what Dan thinks
Samvrutha Tumuluru: but after seeing this picture
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Might be a hard pass for me
Samvrutha Tumuluru: for radius
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I’m on the same boat as u @Samvrutha
Chris Acker: I don't mind coming to check it out
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: Ok let’s do that and we decide tmr
Chris Acker: I texted their number and asked if there was any availability
Chris Acker: and then they sent me a welcome email
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: how did they get my email???
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Lol
Yuta Baba: Creepy
Yuta Baba: @Samvrutha I would that it would happen at Encore, it has a releasing office in the first floor so if something happens they would notice
Yuta Baba: *i dont think it would happen at Encore
Samvrutha Tumuluru: lol tbh I'm not sure how radius has maintained such a high rating on google with the number of 1 stars 😂😂
Samvrutha Tumuluru: They have gotten hardly any good reviews in the last like 2 years
Yuta Baba: Lol
Yuta Baba: I mean it looks from outside
Yuta Baba: But mailboxes are cray cray
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Ok cool I guess we will see how it is tomorrow. If it seems sketch then I've made my peace with the room size at encore
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: What about Dan's house?
Chris Acker: If we check and it has air conditioning are we still interested?
Chris Acker: Should we reach out to them?
Yuta Baba: If we can negotiate the price
Yuta Baba: Idk
Chris Acker: Okay so encore is your hard limit price wise?
Chris Acker: It’s funny that we don’t like radius and it might be more expensive lol
Yuta Baba: I mean that would be great
Chris Acker: I can’t imagine the list of things that could go well for radius for us to change our mind about this
Yuta Baba: Dans house is like 3br 3 bathroom so I would say even split that would be like 1.8k
Yuta Baba: It’s a bit pricy
Chris Acker: What do you mean by even split?
Chris Acker: It’s 5550/month and there are 4 of us
Yuta Baba: 3 bedroom 3 bathrooms so dan/Samvrutha pays 1/3 you pay 1/3 and I pay 1/3 no?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think the house is only an option if they are willing to negotiate the price and it has air conditioning
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: No Dan and Samvrutha would pay more because a house is more than its bedrooms
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: maybe we just reach out to them and see if they are flexible?
Yuta Baba reacted with 👍
Yuta Baba: @Chris Acker 1040 tmr?
Chris Acker reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: How's it looking
Chris Acker: It’s not available lol
Chris Acker: The unit
Chris Acker: So we are not going
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Chris Acker: The person from the house got back to me tho and said they’d be willing to do 5300
Chris Acker: But they did not answer my question as to whether or not there was air conditioning
Chris Acker: The person I was in contact with told me to “call their husband about that” lol
Chris Acker: I called but no one picked up
Chris Acker: Left a message

Yuta Baba: Sunday is closed for them
Chris Acker: We don’t know if they were already talking to people when we came
Yuta Baba: He would’ve mentioned if that’s the case but sure
Yuta Baba: The house is in demand it can be taken super fast
Yuta Baba: Don’t know how often the apartment opens up tho
Chris Acker: Hopefully
Yuta Baba reacted with 🙏
Daniel Strizhevsky: Samvrutha has done some Masterful Interior Designing work and we've decided we will be able to fit a bed + 2 desks in the Encore master

Yuta Baba: Let us know when you hear back from them Chris
Chris Acker: The number they have on their website does not work
Yuta Baba: Wtf
Chris Acker: And the number in louiegi’s automated response email also doesn’t work lol
Yuta Baba: So no one in the office today?
Yuta Baba: Maybe we have to wait for another day lol
Chris Acker: We can apply online, but it doesn’t let me select a start date past the 10th
Yuta Baba: Hmm
Chris Acker: I don’t know.  It said the number was out of service
Yuta Baba: That’s weird
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevskywhat number did you call?
Chris Acker: Did you just call louiegi directly?
Yuta Baba: Louiieeeegi where u at
Chris Acker: We could submit an application online, but the start date would have to be the 10th
Chris Acker: Maybe we could ask them to change that later? Not sure
Yuta Baba: Can we leave a comment in the application?
Yuta Baba: Saying we prefer a later start date
Chris Acker: I don’t think so
Yuta Baba: Hmmmmmm
Yuta Baba: You tried these right

Call 833-761-3073
Email encore@sares-regis.com
Chris Acker: Wait I typed in the number wrong lol
Chris Acker: One sec
Chris Acker: Okay now I’m getting through to the number but it’s stuck in a loop lol
Chris Acker: Call the number and you will se what I mean
Daniel Strizhevsky: I called +16504740400 I think
Daniel Strizhevsky: Jk
Daniel Strizhevsky: That's what they called me back from
Daniel Strizhevsky: I called 8337613073
Chris Acker: Yeah that’s what I tried
Chris Acker: It just says “press one to continue” on loop
Chris Acker: (Yes, I pressed it)
Yuta Baba: What the fuck
Yuta Baba: This is infinite loop
Yuta Baba: Someone fix this annoying bug
Samvrutha Tumuluru: The number dan sent just goes to voicemail
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But no infinite loop
Yuta Baba: The one starting with 833
Yuta Baba: That goes to the loop
Yuta Baba: Let’s try pressing 2
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Sorry the first number he sent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It goes to luigies voicemail
Yuta Baba: That might break the while loop
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Just kidding second number is not an infinite loop eaither
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I pressed 1 and then it took me to the same voicemail
Chris Acker: It should definitely not take you to louiegi’s voicemail because that is the encore number
Chris Acker: Did you get the voice saying that a service agent would be with you shortly
Yuta Baba: Actually I pressed few other buttons and then 1 and the phone started behaving like a norma phone does but not one picked it up
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I guess I’m assuming it’s Luigi
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It was just a dude saying blah blah encore leave message will call back
Yuta Baba: Luigi we are marios answer ur phone plz
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: But he had an accent
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I guess unfair to assume
Yuta Baba: But is it just him working at a leasing office?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I mean it never says this is Luigi
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Or anything
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Louie go
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I mean doesn’t matter it goes to voicemail was my point lol
Yuta Baba: He’ll get back to us tmr
Chris Acker: Hmm weird
Chris Acker: I never got to that point
Chris Acker: You are saying that the two phone numbers lead to the same answering machine?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Try the 165 number
Samvrutha Tumuluru: It skips the automated lady
Chris Acker: I did
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Oh weird
Chris Acker: Yeah I agree with that one
Chris Acker: The 165 goes to an answering machine
Yuta Baba: Maybe u r blocked Chris
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: The 833 leads to a press one loop
Daniel Strizhevsky: hey well if we can't reach them other people probably can't lol
Chris Acker: No one would ever block me trust me
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: They know the consequences
Daniel Strizhevsky: as long as The Competition is Dead
Daniel Strizhevsky: we should be good
Chris Acker: Yuta run to the apartment and see if anyone is there!

Yuta Baba: I can
Daniel Strizhevsky: no, we mustn't seem needy
Chris Acker: Including luigi

Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 🦖

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: Cradling his knees
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: btw would you guys consider Purchasing a house?
Daniel Strizhevsky: instead of renting
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Negatives
Daniel Strizhevsky: shut it
Chris Acker reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Shut it
Daniel Strizhevsky: could be more economical to Purchase a house
Yuta Baba: If i know for sure I stay in CA for a longer time I could
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Negatives p
Chris Acker: R u serious?
Chris Acker: Cant tell
Daniel Strizhevsky: i am serious
Daniel Strizhevsky: i mean
Daniel Strizhevsky: i don't htink i will stay in CA for particularly long
Daniel Strizhevsky: but we can just sell after 1-1.5 years
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Nuggative
Chris Acker: How would it work with 4 of us on the thingy
Yuta Baba: My friend who’s moving to MN for phd is buying a house
Chris Acker: How much would the down payment be
Yuta Baba: Not a lot
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Chicken nugget
Yuta Baba: But selling after a year is not good
Chris Acker: Why
Yuta Baba: Why would u buy a house in the first place
Yuta Baba: For just one year
Chris Acker: Because then you don’t lose money
Chris Acker: Theoretically
Chris Acker: If you rent you just lose the money
Daniel Strizhevsky: because your monthly cost is almost the same as renting yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you get equity for it
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you can capture real estate price increases on top of that
Daniel Strizhevsky: although it's higher risk
Daniel Strizhevsky: like
Chris Acker: You only lose money if the price goes down
Chris Acker: With renting you are throwing away 20k per year
Yuta Baba: Which is highly unlikely
Daniel Strizhevsky: we're making a $63k investment already here
Yuta Baba: I don’t know the tax implications of buying a house
Chris Acker: There would be taxes
Chris Acker: And some interest rate set by the bank
Yuta Baba: I HATE TAXES
Chris Acker: And perhaps property repair expenses
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah Texas is the worst state IMO
Chris Acker: So it’s not like an all around better choice
Yuta Baba: Where did Texas come from lmao
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: we can do some math i guess
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + closing costs + inspection costs
Daniel Strizhevsky: and interest rates are like under 3% right now i think
Chris Acker: Yuta won the math award at my high school
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + time and effort of buying and selling a house
Chris Acker: He’s got us
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + the cost of paying 2 rents if we move and then can’t sell the house in time
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok yuta go math it out
Yuta Baba: That was four years ago
Chris Acker: Did you get dummer?
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: And I’m not calculating taxes
Yuta Baba: Cuz I don’t know the rules
Yuta Baba: I only know taxes in investment
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think you get some tax incentives if you own a house though
Chris Acker: Nah you pay property taxes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: That is what I noticed while doing my taxes a couple weeks avo
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah but they give you some credits back
Chris Acker: In California they even make you pay a few hundred dollar towards education to support the local schools
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Kinda like electric car incentives
Yuta Baba: I mean do we want to just wait for another day our luigi is gon get back to us
Yuta Baba: If we want to buy a house we need to find a place first
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I don’t think this is the time to buy a house IMO
Chris Acker: I feel like you can get tax incentives to lower your property taxes but i didn’t think they would be a net positive
Yuta Baba: If we sell it a few years later it will for sure
Yuta Baba: Appreciation
Chris Acker: Yeah if we only own it for a year I’m not sure that the complexity is worth it
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not net positive just something to factor in
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If we are doing some calculations
Yuta Baba: I would want to study taxes but not the right timing cuz it’s the end of fiscal quarter
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: And agreed not sure if it’s worth it given all the complexities
Daniel Strizhevsky: fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: house DEAD
Chris Acker reacted with 🥳
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 🔪
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What floor was the encore apartment?

Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: one QUESTIONO about ENCORE
Daniel Strizhevsky: are there ceiling lights in the living room? i see that there are in the hallway and kitchen area
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i didn't get to see the living room
Daniel Strizhevsky: or would we need to lamp it up
Yuta Baba: Looking at the photos we might need to lamp it up
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: Might not have a lot of lightings in bedrooms either
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah no lights in bedrooms i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: that's another positive of the house i guess
Yuta Baba: Ugh that’s annoying
Yuta Baba: How do we hook it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: wdym
Yuta Baba: Engineer
Daniel Strizhevsky: buy lamp
Daniel Strizhevsky: plug in
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Yuta Baba: I do have lamps but from the ceiling ya know
Daniel Strizhevsky: :O
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk how that would work
Daniel Strizhevsky: we used floor lamps in the past
Daniel Strizhevsky: the ones we had in metropolitan were quite ugly but we can get nicer ones
Yuta Baba: I guess I can also buy some sting lightings that college kids have
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: That makes my room cool
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I love string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: i hate string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Yuta Baba: *ateing lightening
Yuta Baba: String lights oh my can’t spell
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Doesn’t give u a lot of lights but it’s cool
Daniel Strizhevsky: it kept falling down in my+samvrutha's room last time lol
Yuta Baba: My room is famous for empty decorations
Daniel Strizhevsky: and shorting
Yuta Baba: Yikes
Yuta Baba: Maybe not then lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: eh they were probably cheap
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Something like this for living room would be nice I think
Yuta Baba: Oh ya for sure
Yuta Baba: I have the lamp I bought for a bike
Yuta Baba: We don’t want to directly flush it at us but I could direct it to the ceiling it might be good
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Or maybe something for my room lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah we'll find something lol
Yuta Baba: Also flash not flush
Yuta Baba: Gooooosh
Daniel Strizhevsky: also we've learned from last time that you can pretty easily get 80-100% value back by selling furniture and stuff at the end of the lease
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i'm pretty open to getting nice things
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan caused string lights to fail
Samvrutha Tumuluru: By insisting we put them too tightly on the wall
Daniel Strizhevsky: i didn't cause them to short though lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And then they would fall off
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I bought really cheap lights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be using string lights in our room
Yuta Baba: I might consider that as well we’ll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll just give you samvrutha's string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: when i take them off
Daniel Strizhevsky: no need to buy any yourself :)
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This will not be the case
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will super glue them to the wall
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Then I will super glue Dan to the opposite wall
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll cut the wall out
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So he must stare at the lights all day
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You won’t do that because I’ve already taken care of super glueing you to the wall
Yuta Baba: I’ll glue u to the samvrutha u guys can stare at each other all day long
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: As long as I have my string lights
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: I thought the bedrooms had ceiling lights
Chris Acker: I remember seeing tiny bulbs
Chris Acker: Maybe 4 of them
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see None Of Such in the video you sent Sir
