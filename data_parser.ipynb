      "1. Best case: I can move out anytime and no additional cost to my housemates which is highly unlikely\n",
      "2. They allow me to sublet my current room\n",
      "3. Worst case: contract is a contract and I have to pay until August.\n",
      "Yuta Baba: Well worst comes to worst I’ll pay to both my current rent and the new rent which is like a lot but I’ll suck it up\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: nah that would suck lol let's not do that\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: hmm\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: if it was option 2, do you think you'd be able to do that by late may/early june?\n",
      "Yuta Baba: That’s my hope if I can find someone\n",

      "Daniel Strizhevsky: because the airbnb I would've booked is already gone lol and i think any reasonable one would cost 2.3k+ for me\n",
      "Yuta Baba: That’s totally fair and I really appreciate that\n",
      "Yuta Baba: Let me shoot an email to the landlord and if I don’t here back for like a couple of days I will reach out to a different person\n",

      "Yuta Baba: Thank u thank u\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: if it ends up option 3\n",
      "Yuta Baba: Late August\n",
      "Yuta Baba: But hey I don’t think that will happen\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: i see\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah hopefully not\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: ok for decision making let's do this:\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 3 i think that just won't work out tbh because then samvrutha wouldn't have a place by the time she comes back and that would be too many moving parts\n",
      "Chris Acker: hmm dan and i could also airbnb the room out or something for a few months...\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: if it's option 1 OR option 2, i think we can work out something that starts late may and just mess around with pricing for a couple weeks if needed\n",
      "Yuta Baba: Can you give me this week to sort it out?\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: or this yeah, but is most likely not legal, or very difficult to set up\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess just from my end, i think i'm going to commit to NOT getting a temporary airbnb\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: and we'll search for both 3br and 2br for now just to be safe\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: and then hopefully book something once you decide\n",
      "Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not option 2 whatever in worst case if needed I too can pitch in\n",
      "Yuta Baba: Yeah sounds good to me and thank u all\n",

      "Chris Acker: especially after you capped rent at 1500 lol\n",
      "Daniel Strizhevsky: also IMO if encore has 1 month off, i'm basically down to just ge tit\n",
