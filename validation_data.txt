Chris Acker shared a link.
work with 4 of us on the thingy
Yuta Baba: My friend who’s moving to MN for phd is buying a house
Chris Acker: How much would the down payment be
Yuta Baba: Not a lot
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Chicken nugget
Yuta Baba: But selling after a year is not good
Chris Acker: Why
Yuta Baba: Why would u buy a house in the first place
Yuta Baba: For just one year
Chris Acker: Because then you don’t lose money
Chris Acker: Theoretically
Chris Acker: If you rent you just lose the money
Daniel Strizhevsky: because your monthly cost is almost the same as renting yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you get equity for it
Daniel Strizhevsky: and you can capture real estate price increases on top of that
Daniel Strizhevsky: although it's higher risk
Daniel Strizhevsky: like
Chris Acker: You only lose money if the price goes down
Chris Acker: With renting you are throwing away 20k per year
Yuta Baba: Which is highly unlikely
Daniel Strizhevsky: we're making a $63k investment already here
Yuta Baba: I don’t know the tax implications of buying a house
Chris Acker: There would be taxes
Chris Acker: And some interest rate set by the bank
Yuta Baba: I HATE TAXES
Chris Acker: And perhaps property repair expenses
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah Texas is the worst state IMO
Chris Acker: So it’s not like an all around better choice
Yuta Baba: Where did Texas come from lmao
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with ❤
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: we can do some math i guess
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + closing costs + inspection costs
Daniel Strizhevsky: and interest rates are like under 3% right now i think
Chris Acker: Yuta won the math award at my high school
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + time and effort of buying and selling a house
Chris Acker: He’s got us
Samvrutha Tumuluru: + the cost of paying 2 rents if we move and then can’t sell the house in time
Daniel Strizhevsky: ok yuta go math it out
Yuta Baba: That was four years ago
Chris Acker: Did you get dummer?
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: And I’m not calculating taxes
Yuta Baba: Cuz I don’t know the rules
Yuta Baba: I only know taxes in investment
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I think you get some tax incentives if you own a house though
Chris Acker: Nah you pay property taxes
Samvrutha Tumuluru: That is what I noticed while doing my taxes a couple weeks avo
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Yeah but they give you some credits back
Chris Acker: In California they even make you pay a few hundred dollar towards education to support the local schools
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Kinda like electric car incentives
Yuta Baba: I mean do we want to just wait for another day our luigi is gon get back to us
Yuta Baba: If we want to buy a house we need to find a place first
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I don’t think this is the time to buy a house IMO
Chris Acker: I feel like you can get tax incentives to lower your property taxes but i didn’t think they would be a net positive
Yuta Baba: If we sell it a few years later it will for sure
Yuta Baba: Appreciation
Chris Acker: Yeah if we only own it for a year I’m not sure that the complexity is worth it
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 👍
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Not net positive just something to factor in
Samvrutha Tumuluru: If we are doing some calculations
Yuta Baba: I would want to study taxes but not the right timing cuz it’s the end of fiscal quarter
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: And agreed not sure if it’s worth it given all the complexities
Daniel Strizhevsky: fine
Daniel Strizhevsky: house DEAD
Chris Acker reacted with 🥳
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 🔪
Samvrutha Tumuluru: What floor was the encore apartment?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Was it the top floor?

Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru sent a sticker.
Daniel Strizhevsky: one QUESTIONO about ENCORE
Daniel Strizhevsky: are there ceiling lights in the living room? i see that there are in the hallway and kitchen area
Daniel Strizhevsky: but i didn't get to see the living room
Daniel Strizhevsky: or would we need to lamp it up
Yuta Baba: Looking at the photos we might need to lamp it up
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Yuta Baba: Might not have a lot of lightings in bedrooms either
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah no lights in bedrooms i think
Daniel Strizhevsky: that's another positive of the house i guess
Yuta Baba: Ugh that’s annoying
Yuta Baba: How do we hook it up
Daniel Strizhevsky: wdym
Yuta Baba: Engineer
Daniel Strizhevsky: buy lamp
Daniel Strizhevsky: plug in
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Yuta Baba: I do have lamps but from the ceiling ya know
Daniel Strizhevsky: :O
Daniel Strizhevsky: idk how that would work
Daniel Strizhevsky: we used floor lamps in the past
Daniel Strizhevsky: the ones we had in metropolitan were quite ugly but we can get nicer ones
Yuta Baba: I guess I can also buy some sting lightings that college kids have
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😢
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with ❤
Yuta Baba: That makes my room cool
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I love string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: i hate string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: lol
Yuta Baba: *ateing lightening
Yuta Baba: String lights oh my can’t spell
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Doesn’t give u a lot of lights but it’s cool
Daniel Strizhevsky: it kept falling down in my+samvrutha's room last time lol
Yuta Baba: My room is famous for empty decorations
Daniel Strizhevsky: and shorting
Yuta Baba: Yikes
Yuta Baba: Maybe not then lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: eh they were probably cheap
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: Something like this for living room would be nice I think
Yuta Baba: Oh ya for sure
Yuta Baba: I have the lamp I bought for a bike
Yuta Baba: We don’t want to directly flush it at us but I could direct it to the ceiling it might be good
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😆
Yuta Baba: Or maybe something for my room lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah we'll find something lol
Yuta Baba: Also flash not flush
Yuta Baba: Gooooosh
Daniel Strizhevsky: also we've learned from last time that you can pretty easily get 80-100% value back by selling furniture and stuff at the end of the lease
Yuta Baba reacted with ❤
Daniel Strizhevsky: so i'm pretty open to getting nice things
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Dan caused string lights to fail
Samvrutha Tumuluru: By insisting we put them too tightly on the wall
Daniel Strizhevsky: i didn't cause them to short though lol
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And then they would fall off
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I bought really cheap lights
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will be using string lights in our room
Yuta Baba: I might consider that as well we’ll see
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll just give you samvrutha's string lights
Daniel Strizhevsky: when i take them off
Daniel Strizhevsky: no need to buy any yourself :)
Samvrutha Tumuluru: This will not be the case
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I will super glue them to the wall
Samvrutha Tumuluru: Then I will super glue Dan to the opposite wall
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Daniel Strizhevsky: i'll cut the wall out
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: So he must stare at the lights all day
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: You won’t do that because I’ve already taken care of super glueing you to the wall
Yuta Baba: I’ll glue u to the samvrutha u guys can stare at each other all day long
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😆
Samvrutha Tumuluru: As long as I have my string lights
Yuta Baba reacted with 😆
Chris Acker: I thought the bedrooms had ceiling lights
Chris Acker: I remember seeing tiny bulbs
Chris Acker: Maybe 4 of them
Daniel Strizhevsky: i see None Of Such in the video you sent Sir
Daniel Strizhevsky: i would Appreciate a punishment sent my way but it seems I will not receive one, as I Am Right? Unfortunate...

Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😢

Chris Acker: Can I add Zachary to this group, as he is a redwood rebel and he likes rice?
Samvrutha Tumuluru: I have no problem with adding young Zachary to this group. But I think we should still use our other chat for general house related stuff so as not to spam Young Baba after he leaves

Daniel Strizhevsky: Hello @Yuta Baba
Daniel Strizhevsky: We are discussing what to do with the communal furniture we all bought
Daniel Strizhevsky: And we were thinking that me, you, and @Samvrutha sell our shares in the furniture to Chris all at a 50% discount to the purchase price
Daniel Strizhevsky: So this would be the couch and TV and tables and all that. We paid a total of ~$650 each for all the furniture, so we'd each get $325 and @Chris would just own all the furniture in full
Daniel Strizhevsky: Do you think that's reasonable or do you have any thoughts??
Yuta Baba: Sounds good to me!
Yuta Baba: Also I don’t think I got a deposit back from encore, we paid the deposit right?
Daniel Strizhevsky: We haven't gotten it back yet

Chris Acker: What the heck is a final utility bill
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah just saw it
Daniel Strizhevsky: It's the utilities we haven't yet paid for I guess
Chris Acker: $376 closing utility bill
Chris Acker: We’re the utilities always that much?  I forget
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah looks like it's usually ~250/mo
Daniel Strizhevsky: And this was 1.5 months
Daniel Strizhevsky: So looks reasonable
Daniel Strizhevsky: Looks basically like what I expected, except he said he usually doesn't charge for carpet cleaning lol
Daniel Strizhevsky: I guess he wasn't feeling nice this time around
Chris Acker: lol
Chris Acker: Well looks like we still owe Encore a little bit of $
Chris Acker: We owe Encore $126.32, to be exact
Chris Acker: I think we also need to consider the fact that the above-mentioned closing utilities were paid in part by Yuta's deposit, which was never paid back to him.
Yuta Baba: Excuse meeeeee
Yuta Baba: But thanks for the info
Chris Acker reacted with ❤
Chris Acker: Yuta obviously shouldn't pay for the utilities, but I think we can all split the cleaning fees based on the proportion of time we each spent at Encore?
Yuta Baba: Agreed
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Yuta Baba: I was gonna say that
Chris Acker: So those are the proportions
Chris Acker: In # of weeks spent at Encore
Chris Acker: Pls correct me if I'm wrong
Chris Acker: Sorry months
Yuta Baba: Sounds about right
Chris Acker: not weeks :)
Chris Acker sent a photo.
Chris Acker: Multiplied by the charges, that is the amount that each of us owe
Chris Acker: Once again, correct me if I did any math incorrectly
Chris Acker: Which means that each of us can make the following payments, one to encore, and one to yuta

Daniel Strizhevsky: @Chris Acker your math looks reasonable
Daniel Strizhevsky: do you want to put the yuta payment in splitwise? and then for encore do we just pay the normal way?
Chris Acker: Is the Splitwise already paid off?  If so maybe we just Venmo?
Daniel Strizhevsky: no it's not paid off
Daniel Strizhevsky: and i wanna put the furtniture stuff in there
Daniel Strizhevsky: wait i think this doesn't add up
Daniel Strizhevsky: this says we're only paying like 39 each total, but the thingy says we each owe 50.5?
Daniel Strizhevsky: (we being you me and samvrutha)
Chris Acker: Hmm let me check
Daniel Strizhevsky: oh it might be the parking credit
Chris Acker: Wait no that’s right
Daniel Strizhevsky: that is causing the discrepancy
Chris Acker: Yeah exactly
Chris Acker: Calculating how much we all owe was just to get the proportion
Chris Acker: Of how much we each need to pay of the outstanding debts to encore and yuta
Chris Acker: I’ve invited you to the spreadsheet if you want to check
Chris Acker: Check your email
Daniel Strizhevsky: yeah it looks right i'm just slightly confused about the parking credit
Daniel Strizhevsky: but it's small enough that idk if it's worth thinking about lol
Daniel Strizhevsky sent a photo.
Daniel Strizhevsky: i guess i'll just start paying this^ ?
Daniel Strizhevsky: any last words??
Chris Acker: If you are okay about the parking credit then yes

Daniel Strizhevsky: because we were supposed to have the opportunity to fix everything ourselves
Chris Acker: Okay
Daniel Strizhevsky: and didn't get that opportunity

Daniel Strizhevsky: ok i'll just remove the stuff that comes after then
Daniel Strizhevsky: @Freddie thoughts on doing that?

Krishna Ammisetty: I agree though, the movie was kinda slow
Krishna Ammisetty: Could’ve been one movie
Samvrutha Tumuluru: We can call it
Chris Acker: I thought the movie moved really quickly.  Way faster than the book.  But they only showed the basic plot line so a lot of character dev is missing

adav: Wait how is private lower
Chris Acker: Private is usually lower
Dhruv Yadav: Damn I wouldn’t have guessed. I’d have assumed private schools have more money since alumni donate at a higher rate
Chris Acker: Private schools get their money from tuition
Dhruv Yadav: Yeah that too
Chris Acker: Public from the government
Chris Acker: It’s just that more teachers want to teach at private schools because the parents (and therefore usually the kids) care more
Chris Acker: Cuz they are paying 20k a year to go there
Chris Acker: Whereas at public schools you get the delinquents and such
Chris Acker: So it’s not as comfy
Chris Acker: So teachers are willing to take the pay cut to go private
Alison Yi Chen reacted with ❤
Dhruv Yadav: But since the tuition is higher wouldn’t the salaries be higher
Dhruv Yadav: I guess there’s lots of factors
Dhruv Yadav: Private schools generally have more upkeep and maintenance with fancy amenities
Dhruv Yadav: So maybe the money goes towards that instead of the teachers
Chris Acker: Maybe, but also perhaps because the demand is higher at private schools, you don’t have to pay as much.  Teachers can’t threaten to quit because there are 3 more in line behind them to fill there spot.

Dhruv Yadav: This past decade it got out of hand with salary given to work accomplished
Alison Yi Chen reacted with 😢
Alison Yi Chen: You mean no more ordering doordash 3 times a day?
Dhruv Yadav: I think swes on tiktok actually exposed themselves
Dhruv Yadav: They kept doing “a day in the life of a googler”
Dhruv Yadav: And they would show them working 2 hours a day
Alison Yi Chen reacted with 😆
Alison Yi Chen: When you say exposed themselves I think got naked
Dhruv Yadav: They basically told on themselves 😂
Dhruv Yadav: Lolololol
Alison Yi Chen: They were probably just trying to make their lives look more fun
Alison Yi Chen: I doubt they actually work 2 hours a day
Dhruv Yadav: I think so but I know a lot of engineers at c1, at one point myself included who’d work like 2 hours a day
Dhruv Yadav: Although I used to get all my work done and just pretended it was taking a whole sprint lolol
Alison Yi Chen reacted with 😆
Alison Yi Chen: I think it depends on how efficient you are
Alison Yi Chen: You may just be a fast engineer
Dhruv Yadav: Oh ya I just do what is required and don’t ask for extra work lol
Dhruv Yadav: Probably should eventually
Alison Yi Chen: I’ve never asked for extra work in my life
Dhruv Yadav: But nice do you get a 0.94% pay raise too
Alison Yi Chen reacted with 😆
Alison Yi Chen: I think I get 4k more
Alison Yi Chen: 4,125
Alison Yi Chen: The difference is very negligible
Alison Yi Chen: But the morale boost is high
Dhruv Yadav: Nice!

Alison Yi Chen: Thank you! it was all bc of kenny's React help
Alison Yi Chen: really pushed me over the edge

David Wang: hey @Caroline Lei, so the new guy was wondering if he could move in early than 2/15 bc hes just staying at an airbnb now. I think if you'd be okay with moving out earlier, we could probably get him to reimburse you for the gained days
Caroline Lei: I’m coming rn to move some stuff out
Caroline Lei: And then I work Tuesday-thurs
Caroline Lei: Was gonna try to move the majority friday sat
Caroline Lei: I can try to clear the room at least if I can just some things in the main area and move that weekend
Caroline Lei: This weekend*
Caroline Lei: How soon does he wanna come in?
David Wang: ah ok
David Wang: he wanted to move in asap bc he's at an airbnb lol but we can tell to him to wait until the weekend. would it be ok with you if I told him to start moving in Sunday?
David Wang: or maybe like you said if you could clear the room Friday/early saturday we could tell him he can at least sleep there Saturday night? I'd be fine if you just sprawled your stuff out into the foyer area or whatever
Caroline Lei: I took a decent amount of my stuff
Caroline Lei: Should be able to do it in one or more trips
Caroline Lei: I have a test tmrrw not a full day work so I’ll probs make a trip in the evening
Caroline Lei: I’ll try to move the rest of my stuff and clear the room possibly. And whatever I can’t take I’ll put in the foyer yeah!
Caroline Lei: So he can probs come even sooner
Caroline Lei: Like weds if I’m able to get the room empty
David Wang: how about we set Friday (as in I tell him to move in Friday night) so I can give him a more definitive date to stop his airbnb and so you don't have to be super rushed?
Caroline Lei: I think I can def take the majority of my things tmrrw! I don’t have much to begin with and i only left basically the bigger objects and my clothes there. And I’ll have my BF helping me with stuff so we’ll have two cars.
Caroline Lei: I’m planning on moving my larger items and if I leave anything just like a few small bags or my shoe rack which I’ll just grab Friday or sat
Caroline Lei: Also giving me a deadline motivates me to move faster hah
David Wang: ok sweet. you think I should tell him Wednesday night or Thursday day?
Caroline Lei: Weds
Caroline Lei: Is fine
David Wang sent a photo.
David Wang: lol I'm done

Chris Acker: @Christopher Knopf @David Wang did we ever get the security deposit from Anurag?  If not we will ask him for it and give it to you @Caroline Lei.  @Christopher Knopf can charge you for utilities after you get the deposit back, (or just deduct it from the deposit, whatever works)
Caroline Lei: either is fine with me
Caroline Lei: tyty
David Wang: I'm not sure - does he pay that to us or directly to action properties?

Chris Acker: And then the second one also made the buzzing?
Daniel Strizhevsky: Yeah
Daniel Strizhevsky: So now I'm not sure if we just didn't notice and they're all like this
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or if we're getting unlucky
Daniel Strizhevsky: Or our setup has something wrong with it

I don’t think a rating of 1449 is that good especially since my rating is 1903. That is an entire 454 points higher. As you can see that is no small difference! Which is why I think 1449 is just not that good. Hehe”
