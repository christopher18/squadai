Samvrutha Tumuluru: Also this pizza looks masterfully crafted. I'm only a level 4 pizza maker you guys must be at least level 64
Chris Acker: We gained several pizza levels today.  We even achieved making cheese-stuffed crusts

Samvrutha Tumuluru: That's an elite skill for sure
Chris Acker: @Daniel Strizhevsky @Samvrutha Tumuluru my friend says that his puzzle rating is 1449 on chess.com but mine is 1903 and I don't even think that 1449 is that good but he thinks it's good.  How do I let him know that his score is not very good and that he has a long way to go without insulting him?

Zach Gospe: Wow welcome sir
Zach Gospe: May I take your order
Chris Acker: I mean, it's okay to be a 1400'er. In a sense…. It just means that you have a lot that you can improve upon in the future!

Zach Gospe: Rice

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Lol you should be honest and open with your friend
Samvrutha Tumuluru: And say “hello Zach (just an example),

I don't think a rating of 1449 is that good especially since my rating is 1903. That is an entire 454 points higher. As you can see that is no small difference! Which is why I think 1449 is just not that good. Hehe”

Samvrutha Tumuluru: Seems like the conversation was a huge success 😂
Chris Acker: Yeah I think it went swimmingly
Daniel Strizhevsky: (just an example)
Daniel Strizhevsky: you silly trackmaniacs
Zach Gospe: Boys it's a good market to buy gpus. I will be upgrading for my birthday. Perhaps we can game together soon if you're considering  gaming computers as well, and we can game such as the new Diablo 4 or something

Daniel Strizhevsky: What are gpu prices like these days
Zach Gospe: 4060s are about $400 and 4070s (what I'm getting) are $600. So super good cards very affordably. The high end cards are also the cheapest they've been in years
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Zach Gospe: I think Chris got his super good 4080 ti rtx for a good price but idk exactly the price
Samvrutha Tumuluru reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: I paid $1,300
Daniel Strizhevsky reacted with 😮
Chris Acker: For the 4080
Zach Gospe: That's such a great deal
Zach Gospe: Plus think of the added friendship value
