      "According to reports, Striz and his team, known as \"The Grokery\", used the hype around Grokoin and Trackmania to lure investors into their scheme. They promised high returns on investments, but in reality, most of the money was being funneled to the top of the pyramid, leaving the vast majority of investors with nothing.\n",
